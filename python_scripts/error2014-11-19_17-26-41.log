The advocate assists patients, family members, pharmacists, and physicians throughout the multistep process, while prospectively tracking compliance with required documentation submitted to the Washington Department of Health. The advocate describes the Death with Dignity process and the alternatives (specifically, palliative care and hospice, with these services offered as additions to, or in lieu of, Death with Dignity). The advocate then assesses the patient's rationale for and interest in further participation. In nearly all cases, family members are present.

The advocate then determines whether the attending physician will act as the prescribing physician. If not, the advocate identifies a prescribing physician and a consulting physician from the list of willing providers, preferentially choosing physicians who specialize in the type of cancer that the patient has. (General care of the patient is not transferred to the prescribing or consulting physician, unless the patient requests this.) The advocate then formally documents the patient's request for assistance with dying and provides the patient with written information that describes the program (including a timeline of the required requests, assessments, and waiting periods), which must be signed by the patient. The advocate also verifies that the patient is a Washington resident and completes a psychosocial assessment. At Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, social workers provide the first line of psychological evaluation for all patients, regardless of whether or not they are participating in the Death with Dignity program, using interview-based techniques and standardized assessments (e.g., the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 questionnaire). Although physicians retain the responsibility to evaluate patients for depression and decision-making capacity, advocates make these assessments as part of their standard practice. Advocates refer patients to the Psychiatry and Psychology Service if there is any history of, or positive screening for, a mental health disorder or impaired decision-making capacity.

Advocates participate in two in-person meetings with the patient and family on average (range, one to four); we have not assessed our use of telephone follow-up.

He also confirmed he was taking antibiotics prior to his trip to Liberia and suspected his Oct. 15 fever was part of a lingering sickness. Boyko recalled conversations Yale officials had with representatives from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who he said declared him "no-risk" after he provided them with details of his trip to Liberia.

She added that there is some question as to whether an initial test for Ebola that comes up negative may turn up positive at a later date. Lazzarini referred to the history of HIV virus testing and said people were "told for years there may be a period of time after initial infection before a test result comes back positive.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-02 Lazzarini added that the statute was co-drafted by the American Civil Liberties Union in conjunction with the DPH.

This even becomes more worrisome as many Nigerian non-smokers are helplessly exposed to cigarette smoke on a daily basis at home, workplace, shops and more. In this report, VICTOR OKEKE writes on why government should show more seriousness in checking smoking in public places in Nigeria.

Among men, the primary cause to exposure at any location were lack of secondary school education, residing in slum apartments (house with many households), living with a smoking family member, lack of smoking restriction laws, and alcohol consumption.

According to a team of researchers from the University of Ilorin, University of Nigeria and Obafemi Awolowo University in a study conducted in three cities in Nigeria, of the 583 non-smoking respondents in the study, up to 40 percent had a regular exposure to passive smoking mostly in public places.

Among men, the primary cause to exposure at any location were lack of secondary school education, residing in slum apartments (house with many households), living with a smoking family member, lack of smoking restriction laws, and alcohol consumption.

This even becomes more worrisome as many Nigerian non-smokers are helplessly exposed to cigarette smoke on a daily basis at home, workplace, shops and more. In this report, VICTOR OKEKE writes on why government should show more seriousness in checking smoking in public places in Nigeria.

If this trend continues unchecked, the predictions of researchers are certainly going to be our lot in this country.

Hearing loss is often viewed as an evitable consequence of old age, but the research shows this may not always be true," said Dr. Piers Dawes.

Three patients with anorexia nervosa and two with EDNOS died. 65 (74%) bulimic, 29 (78%) EDNOS, and 53 (56%) anorexic patients had no diagnosable eating disorder. A small proportion of patients in every group had poor Morgan-- Russell-Hayward scores at outcome. Final outcome was predicted by extent and intensity, but not duration, of initial symptoms in patients with anorexia nervosa, and by initial body-related attitudes and impaired psychosocial functioning in bulimia patients. We were unable to predict EDNOS outcome. Treatment did not affect outcome for any group.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-03Dementia represents a significant clinical challenge, with an estimated 35.6 million people with dementia in the world, of whom 4.38 million reside in the United States (1, 2). Ninety percent of people with dementia experience behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia at some point during their illness. Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia commonly manifest as agitation, aggression, depression, or psychosis (hallucinations and delusions), which can cause significant distress to the person and their caregiver as well as have a direct effect on the person's quality of life and likelihood of institutionalization. Although the majority of best practice guidelines emphasize the importance of nonpharmacological treatments and judicious short-term use of pharmacological treatment for behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, antipsychotic drugs are commonly used as a first-line approach for managing these symptoms. It is therefore a critical issue to understand the clinical efficacy and safety profile of individual antipsychotics to inform guidance on prescribing practice and choice of antipsychotic medication in situations where a prescription is deemed necessary. In this issue of the Journal  , the cohort study conducted by Kales et al. (3) provides extremely valuable new knowledge pertinent to these key treatment decisions.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-03A substantial number of trials have focused on the effectiveness of atypical antipsychotics for the treatment of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia. In total, 18 placebo-controlled randomized controlled trials conducted over a 6- to 12-week period have been undertaken in people with Alzheimer's disease. The best evidence of efficacy for the treatment of agitation, aggression, and psychosis relates to risperidone. Five trials have indicated a modest but significant improvement in aggression and psychosis, equating to a small treatment effect size (Cohen's d=0.2 at the optimal dose) (4, 5). However, this must be considered in the context of the widely reported side effects of atypical antipsychotics, which include extrapyramidal symptoms, sedation, gait disturbances, and falls. Many agents also lead to anticholinergic side effects, including delirium (4). Tardive dyskinesia with atypical antipsychotics appears to occur less frequently than with typical antipsychotics, but QTc prolongation has been reported as a significant problem associated with several atypical antipsychotics. A meta-analysis also identified a significant increase in respiratory and urinary tract infections as well as peripheral edema in people treated with risperidone, compared with placebo (4). These are likely to be class effects of atypical antipsychotics. It has also become clear that other, more serious adverse outcomes, such as stroke and related cerebrovascular events, accelerated cognitive decline, and death, are significantly increased in people with dementia who are prescribed antipsychotics, compared with people with dementia not treated with these agents. Deaths related to bronchopneumonia, thrombo-embolic events (including stroke and pulmonary embolism), and sudden cardiac arrhythmias are all significantly increased in people with dementia receiving antipsychotic treatment (6).

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-03The most significant clinical issue has been the increased mortality associated with antipsychotic use among people with dementia. An initial meta-analysis completed by the Food and Drug Administration (7), which has been confirmed by independent analyses, highlighted a 1.5- to 1.7-fold increase in mortality risk for people with Alzheimer's disease receiving antipsychotics, compared with placebo, over 6-12 weeks in randomized clinical trials. Subsequent work has demonstrated that this significant risk is elevated and persistent in cases of longer-term exposure to antipsychotics (8). Key questions for clinical practice include whether there are differences in mortality risk between different antipsychotics, what the mechanisms leading to increased mortality are, and whether aspects of mortality can be prevented.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-03The Kales et al. study contributes valuable new evidence regarding the safety of antipsychotics. The study examined the relative risk of mortality associated with newly commenced prescriptions of olanzapine, quetiapine, and haloperidol, compared with risperidone as the reference compound, in a cohort of more than 30,000 veterans with dementia, ages 65 years and older. Importantly, haloperidol was associated with significantly greater mortality than risperidone (relative risk=1.54). Several studies have suggested that haloperidol confers a greater mortality risk than atypical antipsychotics (9), but the Kales et al. report is one of the few to have systematically compared mortality risk between different atypical antipsychotic agents. Olanzapine and risperidone had similar mortality risk, while the risk for quetiapine was significantly lower (relative risk=0.73). A key observation is that the highest increase in mortality risk was in the first 120 days, particularly in the first 30 days for haloperidol. In addition to the important findings of the study, it also has several key methodological advantages that add to its value. The study population was specifically older people with dementia, and there was a focus on new prescriptions of antipsychotics. Both these design elements help to remove many of the potential confounding factors.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-03One important consideration in implementing the evidence from this study into clinical practice is to balance safety and efficacy. Kales et al. report that the lowest mortality risk was associated with quetiapine. However, three randomized controlled trials of quetiapine did not demonstrate any effectiveness in the treatment of aggression, agitation, or psychosis (4, 5). The best evidence of efficacy is for risperidone, with consistent evidence of a modest but significant benefit over 12 weeks in the treatment of both aggression and psychosis. There is also evidence of a similar level of benefit with aripiprazole, olanzapine, and haloperiodol, but only a few studies have examined other agents. Through balancing the mortality data from this study and efficacy data from previous randomized controlled trials, risperidone and olanzapine emerge as the best evidence-based options.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-03The growing body of evidence regarding the safety risks associated with antipsychotics has led to considerable pressure to reduce prescribing practice. It is imperative that this is conducted within a framework to improve the overall management of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, including appropriate use of nondrug treatments, effective treatment of pain (10), and judicious short-term use of antipsychotics when their use is clinically indicated. In this regard, the Kales et al. study provides further evidence to support the use of risperidone and olanzapine where an antipsychotic is deemed necessary.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-03Another major clinical imperative is to deliver treatment and care to proactively reduce the mortality associated with antipsychotics when they are appropriately prescribed. In addition to the aforementioned causes of mortality, meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials have reported significant incidence of sedation, chest-infection, and dehydration (4), offering insight into the mediating pathways of more escalating events leading to death. It is likely that better care of people who are prescribed antipsychotics, for example, by monitoring fluid intake and promoting vigilance for early detection and treatment of chest infections, may offer important potential opportunities to reduce excess mortality. The potential role of ECG monitoring for prolonged QTc interval should perhaps also be considered, although this is more challenging in routine clinical practice. Practical approaches for these elements of clinical practice are outlined in a new evidence-based best practice guide for preventing and managing behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (11).

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-03The Kales et al. study provides important data for a better understanding of optimal and safer clinical use of antipsychotics. Their findings should be considered within the context of data on antipsychotic efficacy and incorporated into the implementation of improved treatment and care for people with dementia who are experiencing behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-03Dementia represents a significant clinical challenge, with an estimated 35.6 million people with dementia in the world, of whom 4.38 million reside in the United States (1, 2). Ninety percent of people with dementia experience behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia at some point during their illness. Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia commonly manifest as agitation, aggression, depression, or psychosis (hallucinations and delusions), which can cause significant distress to the person and their caregiver as well as have a direct effect on the person's quality of life and likelihood of institutionalization. Although the majority of best practice guidelines emphasize the importance of nonpharmacological treatments and judicious short-term use of pharmacological treatment for behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, antipsychotic drugs are commonly used as a first-line approach for managing these symptoms. It is therefore a critical issue to understand the clinical efficacy and safety profile of individual antipsychotics to inform guidance on prescribing practice and choice of antipsychotic medication in situations where a prescription is deemed necessary. In this issue of the Journal  , the cohort study conducted by Kales et al. (3) provides extremely valuable new knowledge pertinent to these key treatment decisions.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-03A substantial number of trials have focused on the effectiveness of atypical antipsychotics for the treatment of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia. In total, 18 placebo-controlled randomized controlled trials conducted over a 6- to 12-week period have been undertaken in people with Alzheimer's disease. The best evidence of efficacy for the treatment of agitation, aggression, and psychosis relates to risperidone. Five trials have indicated a modest but significant improvement in aggression and psychosis, equating to a small treatment effect size (Cohen's d=0.2 at the optimal dose) (4, 5). However, this must be considered in the context of the widely reported side effects of atypical antipsychotics, which include extrapyramidal symptoms, sedation, gait disturbances, and falls. Many agents also lead to anticholinergic side effects, including delirium (4). Tardive dyskinesia with atypical antipsychotics appears to occur less frequently than with typical antipsychotics, but QTc prolongation has been reported as a significant problem associated with several atypical antipsychotics. A meta-analysis also identified a significant increase in respiratory and urinary tract infections as well as peripheral edema in people treated with risperidone, compared with placebo (4). These are likely to be class effects of atypical antipsychotics. It has also become clear that other, more serious adverse outcomes, such as stroke and related cerebrovascular events, accelerated cognitive decline, and death, are significantly increased in people with dementia who are prescribed antipsychotics, compared with people with dementia not treated with these agents. Deaths related to bronchopneumonia, thrombo-embolic events (including stroke and pulmonary embolism), and sudden cardiac arrhythmias are all significantly increased in people with dementia receiving antipsychotic treatment (6).

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-03The most significant clinical issue has been the increased mortality associated with antipsychotic use among people with dementia. An initial meta-analysis completed by the Food and Drug Administration (7), which has been confirmed by independent analyses, highlighted a 1.5- to 1.7-fold increase in mortality risk for people with Alzheimer's disease receiving antipsychotics, compared with placebo, over 6-12 weeks in randomized clinical trials. Subsequent work has demonstrated that this significant risk is elevated and persistent in cases of longer-term exposure to antipsychotics (8). Key questions for clinical practice include whether there are differences in mortality risk between different antipsychotics, what the mechanisms leading to increased mortality are, and whether aspects of mortality can be prevented.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-03The Kales et al. study contributes valuable new evidence regarding the safety of antipsychotics. The study examined the relative risk of mortality associated with newly commenced prescriptions of olanzapine, quetiapine, and haloperidol, compared with risperidone as the reference compound, in a cohort of more than 30,000 veterans with dementia, ages 65 years and older. Importantly, haloperidol was associated with significantly greater mortality than risperidone (relative risk=1.54). Several studies have suggested that haloperidol confers a greater mortality risk than atypical antipsychotics (9), but the Kales et al. report is one of the few to have systematically compared mortality risk between different atypical antipsychotic agents. Olanzapine and risperidone had similar mortality risk, while the risk for quetiapine was significantly lower (relative risk=0.73). A key observation is that the highest increase in mortality risk was in the first 120 days, particularly in the first 30 days for haloperidol. In addition to the important findings of the study, it also has several key methodological advantages that add to its value. The study population was specifically older people with dementia, and there was a focus on new prescriptions of antipsychotics. Both these design elements help to remove many of the potential confounding factors.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-03One important consideration in implementing the evidence from this study into clinical practice is to balance safety and efficacy. Kales et al. report that the lowest mortality risk was associated with quetiapine. However, three randomized controlled trials of quetiapine did not demonstrate any effectiveness in the treatment of aggression, agitation, or psychosis (4, 5). The best evidence of efficacy is for risperidone, with consistent evidence of a modest but significant benefit over 12 weeks in the treatment of both aggression and psychosis. There is also evidence of a similar level of benefit with aripiprazole, olanzapine, and haloperiodol, but only a few studies have examined other agents. Through balancing the mortality data from this study and efficacy data from previous randomized controlled trials, risperidone and olanzapine emerge as the best evidence-based options.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-03The growing body of evidence regarding the safety risks associated with antipsychotics has led to considerable pressure to reduce prescribing practice. It is imperative that this is conducted within a framework to improve the overall management of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, including appropriate use of nondrug treatments, effective treatment of pain (10), and judicious short-term use of antipsychotics when their use is clinically indicated. In this regard, the Kales et al. study provides further evidence to support the use of risperidone and olanzapine where an antipsychotic is deemed necessary.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-03Another major clinical imperative is to deliver treatment and care to proactively reduce the mortality associated with antipsychotics when they are appropriately prescribed. In addition to the aforementioned causes of mortality, meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials have reported significant incidence of sedation, chest-infection, and dehydration (4), offering insight into the mediating pathways of more escalating events leading to death. It is likely that better care of people who are prescribed antipsychotics, for example, by monitoring fluid intake and promoting vigilance for early detection and treatment of chest infections, may offer important potential opportunities to reduce excess mortality. The potential role of ECG monitoring for prolonged QTc interval should perhaps also be considered, although this is more challenging in routine clinical practice. Practical approaches for these elements of clinical practice are outlined in a new evidence-based best practice guide for preventing and managing behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (11).

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-03The Kales et al. study provides important data for a better understanding of optimal and safer clinical use of antipsychotics. Their findings should be considered within the context of data on antipsychotic efficacy and incorporated into the implementation of improved treatment and care for people with dementia who are experiencing behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia.

For all its troubles, the company is still Apple.

Only a week before he made the jump, he spoke enthusiastically about leading the company to the next plateau--Phase Two, he calls it. In his grand scheme, Phase One involves nursing sick companies back to health; Phase Two is actually transforming them into great companies. He talked enthusiastically about building National into a bigger, more important player in the semiconductor industry.

"We can't afford to disrespect nurses."

Rosenstein said he had trouble finding information on the possible link between physician behavior and nurse satisfaction. Seeking answers, he launched the study in part to "develop policies to deal with it"

"Nurses, doctors and hospital executives differed in their beliefs about responsibility, barriers to progress and potential solutions to this concern," Rosenstein said.

Long-held habits, one doctor said, may make it difficult for physicians to change how they treat other members of the healthcare team.

Halford, who reviewed the VHA study, said the collaboration necessary to prevent disruptive behavior is much easier said than done.

"You have to continually look at what you can do to promote communication, which translates into safer, better, more efficient care." Halford cautioned that although the VHA study highlights an important problem, physicians' treatment of nurses is not the only factor in their diminishing morale. Nursing, he said, "doesn't pay what it should given the amount of work and stress involved, and the physical and mental demands. It's a tough job. You have to be on your toes."

The study is similar to one conducted earlier this year by the AHA, which found 84% of hospitals were experiencing a registered nurse shortage.

People who learn that the outgoing, take-charge Durkee was homeschooled are surprised. "There's a stereotype of homeschoolers-that we're reclusive geeks," she says. "I'm not that way at all. I'm extroverted, a leader and interact well with others. Homeschooling has helped me decide what I believe for myself and not to be afraid to express my views."

Indeed, most parents who homeschool their children are guided at least partly by religious principles, and many are evangelical Christians. But some parents who homeschool their children are Muslims, Orthodox Jews or of other faiths, and still others are driven more by secular educational philosophies rather than religion. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-03As the homeschool movement goes mainstream, it is converting thousands of parents fed up with perceived shortcomings in public education. The number of homeschooled children has tripled over the past decade. Those in the first wave have graduated, gone to college and entered the workforce, and now employers are getting their first glimpse of what homeschoolers can do. Anecdotal reports show that homeschoolers are thriving. Long before they get their first full-time jobs, many have accrued years of experience through apprenticeships, part-time employment or work in their own enterprises or in their families' businesses.

Also, most homeschooled students go on to school their own children at home, creating a greater need for flexible work schedules. Moreover, homeschool vendors are gearing up to offer package deals to employers on curricula and materials that can be added to companies' benefit packages.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-03As many as 1 million children-up from approximately 300,000 in 1988-are being homeschooled. The U.S. Department of Education's National Center for Educational Statistics (NCES) in August released the first-ever comprehensive study on homeschooling and pegged the number at 850,000 students in 1999. The actual number could be almost 17 percent higher or lower, says NCES statistician Stephen Broughman. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-03Some observers think there are more than 1 million homeschoolers. Brian Ray, president of the National Home Education Research Institute (NHERI), a home education information and research organization in Salem, Ore., believes his estimate of 1.2 million to 1.8 million is reliable. "Homeschool people are very privacy-oriented, slow to give information to government entities," he says. "Because I'm viewed as objective by homeschoolers and [by] state and federal governments, all are less reticent about sharing information with me."

The fledgling company, founded by former Secretary of Education William Bennett, is attracting investors who are convinced there's gold in the burgeoning homeschool market. "There are between 1 [million] and 1.8 million homeschoolers," Packard says. "Twenty percent are on the fringes-the `preach and teach' faction that want religion embedded in every subject, and the 'unschoolers' who don't want any formal education. Neither of these is for us. Our market is the 80 percent in the middle-religious and secular-who are united in that they want a great education for their kids."

Homeschooling is a boutique option, but it's legitimate."

In the 1970s, there were 15,000 home-educated children. According to Ray and others, the total will increase 7 percent to 12 percent per year. Growth in recent years has been fueled by .violence, health issues and dissatisfaction with public education," says Laura Derrick, president of the National Home Education Network (NHEN), a national advocacy group in Austin, Texas.

While some states mandate that homeschoolers submit curricula for approval, keep logs of subjects covered each year and have students take regular standardized tests, others leave it completely to the discretion of the parents. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-03Homeschool families typically start out relying on established curricula or trying to replicate public school as they recall it. As they get more comfortable, they adjust, settling into a modus operandi more their own. Parents who lack expertise in a particular subject may find another parent or a tutor to provide instruction, or they may have the student enroll in a community college or correspondence course or school online.

"None of us has the expertise to do it all, but we do have the expertise to be good networkers, to find people who do have the skills and are enthusiastic about teaching," Cohen says. "My job was to help uncover options, and there are a lot of them," including correspondence schools, community resources and now the Internet. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-03Because of homeschooling, Cohen says, "our kids got so far ahead. What it takes a school seven or eight hours to do, we were able to do in an hour and a half. We'd do academics for three hours a day and be finished, including any homework assignments." Cohen says her children could decide how to use their free time, "except they couldn't watch TV or mindless videos. ... My son got a private pilot's license; my daughter earned money to study abroad in Australia. Both signed on for volunteer work and paying jobs, and as a result, they had a pretty good sense of the work world before they hit college age."

His wife, Carla, does most of the day-to-day instruction of the seven of their 10 children still at home. Her teaching day starts at 8 a.m. and usually ends at 1:30, followed by another hour for grading and organizing the curriculum. Joe teaches math and science about two hours each week. He's a graduate of Kennesaw Junior College-- now Kennesaw State University-near Atlanta. Carla graduated from Rockmont College in Denver with a major in music. One of the three Jeffcoat daughters who completed homeschooling is a composer and piano teacher, another is an artist and painter who's also an assistant manager at Chick-fil-A, and the third teaches writing for homeschoolers.

Like many families undertaking homeschooling, his began by replicating a traditional curriculum. "We got burned out because we tried too hard to copy the public school method at home," Notgrass says. "Then we relaxed and developed our own approaches. We are believers in Christ but take a less formal approach than many evangelicals. We believe in having the family learn together." Besides being homeschooled, Notgrass has taken high school, college and correspondence courses and has studied subjects such as physics and calculus on his own. He scored a combined 1510 out of a possible 1600 on his SATs. Homeschoolers average 60 points higher than other students on verbal and math SATs, according to the U.S. Department of Education. In 1997, Notgrass joined his parents to form the Notgrass Co., which writes and sells curricula in Tennessee history for homeschooling families. He handles the firm's finances and web site.

She says her mother based her homeschooling on a variation of unschooling-a term referring to those who direct their own education, also called interest-initiated learning. "I had to use textbooks to meet college requirements," she says, "but otherwise my mom let me take responsibility for my education. She was a helpmate and fellow learner." Pestinger says homeschooling helped her become selfreliant. "It's made me realize that if there's something I need to learn, I have to figure out how to do it."

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-03Critics of homeschooling argue that it isolates children at home with their families, thereby stifling their ability to interact effectively with the diverse world around them and leaving them inadequately prepared for the working world. "There are a few stories and cases that bear witness to that," says Knowles. "But most modern home educators are involved in their communities and participate in a wide range of activities. If you went to a conference where these people meet, you'd see these kids are very capable."

We did art and physical education; I was in 4-H. I had a good mix of friends, including those who went to public schools. We went to the mall, the movies ... did things all kids do."

The NEA went on record with a resolution opposing homeschooling, saying such programs cannot provide students with a comprehensive education experience. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-03"Too often missing from the debate! on homeschooling," says NEA spokesperson Melinda Anderson, .are the benefits that public schools provide children, like educating children to live and work in a global society where they will have to interact with people from different races, backgrounds and ethnic groups. This is best taught by experience ... and public schools provide such experiences. Public schools also offer students the chance to sharpen skills required in today's job market, like problem solving in cooperative groups."

"We tend to overemphasize the civilizing impact of conventional schools," Stevens says. "The typical school is not a haven of diversity. Public schools are widely segregated by class and race." 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-03To counter the socialization argument, some homeschool parents seek to have their children take part in public schools' extracurricular activities. The NEA is against such participation, and it appears that most school districts also oppose it. The NCES reported that only 28 percent of homeschool parents in its survey said their public schools offered extracurricular activities to homeschoolers, 21 percent reported they can get curriculum support and 23 percent said they're offered books and materials. The percentages of homeschool families that took advantage of these opportunities were substantially lower.

"He had a level of maturity well beyond what we would expect of someone his age," Turner says. "He had the ability to organize things, to think independently and to think out of the box."

Poe spent two years at George Mason University, living at home, and then moved on to Virginia Tech, where he graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering. His boss, Rob Black, manager of ballistics, didn't know Poe was homeschooled before hiring him. The bottom line for Black, an aerospace engineer, is results. "David is typical of the engineers that work here," he says. "He's a self-starter; he's intelligent, good with math and is a logical thinker. He works in teams as well as anyone with his experience."

How do you know if they're on the level? 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-03"There has to be some kind of objective measurement," argues Andrea Edwards, vice president of marketing at Staffmark in Fayetteville, Ark., a staffing company with 250 offices nationwide. "We ask for a high school diploma or an equivalent. It could be a GED [general equivalency diploma] or some other test that proves you have mastered the equivalent of a certified high school diploma." 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-03Requiring the GED as an equivalent to a diploma for employment rankles Chris Klicka, senior counsel at the Homeschool Legal Defense Association (HSLDA), a Purcellville, Va., organization that has led legal battles to legitimize homeschooling. Judge people by what they can do, not by pieces of paper, he urges. "The GED is for dropouts; it carries a stigma," adds Klicka, who also is the author of Homeschooling: The Right Choice (Loyal Publishing, 2000). "There shouldn't be any stigma attached to home education."

"Homeschoolers are aware of what they need to do to meet diploma standards. Some enroll in correspondence schools that are licensed to grant certified degrees; many prepare portfolios that demonstrate their com- petence; others take the GED. I don't count the GED as discriminatory. It's an easy way for a homeschooler to satisfy the diploma requirement."

Homeschool advocates say parents could work part time if employers supported their schedules. Flextime, reduced schedules, requests for permission to use the computer to chat and instruct-all would help. Home teaching with online support, advocates are quick to point out, need not be a full-time venture; some may choose to supplement public schooling with part-time home education.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-03At Chick-fil-A, the proof is in the batter, so to speak. The company recruits homeschoolers, finding their work ethic and personal qualities an unbeatable combination. Jeffcoat, the Chick-fil-A operator in Columbia, has employed 75 homeschoolers over the past 13 years. Currently, 10 of his 100 workers are homeschoolers, ages 15 and 16. He readily admits he favors homeschoolers. "People assume they will be socially handicapped because they've been home- bound, but it's just the opposite," Jeffcoat says. "They have a good sense of humor and know how to act. Lots of kids have trouble with judgment, differentiating what's appropriate behavior in the work environment and on the ball field. Not these kids. They're stable and mature, good team players and likely to stand up for what they think is right."

Cutting through the stereotypes, Lines, who has studied the movement for many years, perhaps says it best. "If I didn't know anything about someone other than their education background, I'd rather hop into a foxhole with a homeschool kid than one from public school. The homeschool kid will be a little better educated and dependable. It's just the law of averages."

Two days of partying ensued involving casinos, helicopter trips to restaurants and dancing on a yacht with Norwegian group Royskopp as a DJ set.

Not that Mojang has had a bad year: Minecraft, a sort of digital version of Lego in which players use blocks to build in a virtual world, helped bring in SKr2.1bn in revenues (up 38 per cent on the previous year) and SKr816m of profit in 2013.

By the end of June it had sold about 54m copies, a figure that is rising all the time - in 24 hours at the start of this week, 18,537 people handed over EUR20 or the equivalent for a PC copy.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-03Minecraft's success is all the more remarkable for what it lacks: the graphics are blocky and unsophisticated, it has few characters and not much of a plot. Instead, players set about building just about any kind of virtual world they can imagine: creations include entire cities, sets from films, space shuttles and even a replica model of Denmark.

It has taken no outside investment, rebuffing numerous venture capitalists and other would-be backers that include Napster founder Sean Parker. Minecraft has become wildly successful on smartphones and tablets despite eschewing the dominant free-to-play - "freemium" - model of games such as Candy Crush Saga and Clash of Clans.

Messrs Persson and Porser wanted to concentrate on making games and so approached Mr Manneh, Mr Persson's former boss at another Swedish start-up, to run and develop the business itself.

In open-necked shirt with sleeves rolled up, he is sitting in a leather chair in a room that not only has a pool table, pinball table and jukebox but a wall covered in gilt-framed, old-fashioned portraits of the first 20 or so Mojang employees as different personas. Mr Manneh is portrayed as a golf player.

Apologies in advance for the inconvenience caused.>Not that Mr Persson does not create mischief for his CEO. An active blogger and presence on Twitter, he created a stir in 2011 when he announced he had sold Mojang to Mr Parker, only to say later it was an April Fool's joke. Earlier this year, Mr Persson tweeted that there would be a Minecraft movie from Warner Bros - the studio that developed The Lego Movie - leading to a deluge of calls to an unsuspecting Mr Manneh. (Nearly all Mojang's 37 employees are on Twitter and they post much of what they are up to every day.)

In his spare time Mr Persson developed Minecraft and within a few months it was making nearly as much money as JAlbum, which had more than 1m users.

The plan was to develop other games but instead Minecraft became a bigger success than anybody imagined. "It was fun to build the blocks but I couldn't really see the potential," admits Mr Manneh, his voice trailing off. However, it was soon clear that Minecraft alone was making more than JAlbum.

Mojang has taken a lower-key ap-proach. Perhaps its most high-profile partnership is the most obvious one: Lego. Minecraft is widely seen as the game the Danish toymaker should have made in its attempt to conquer the digital world but its own plan, Lego Universe, flopped.

In a striking reversal, Mojang executives even think the small newcomer can take children back to the original spirit of Lego.

By contrast, the Minecraft sets will encourage people to tear them apart and rebuild. "I know that at Lego part of its culture is to want people to remember they can rebuild things," he adds.

Mr Porser developed Scrolls, a cross between a board game and collectible cards, but it has failed to come near the success of Minecraft.

Instead his first post-Minecraft game was the release in June of the throwaway Cliffhorse, knocked out in a few hours, according to Mr Persson's tweets.

Even in a quieter setting, he sometimes misses the first few words someone says.

At school in the fall, he found it difficult to hear his friends in the cafeteria. He had frequent headaches and ear pain. Finally, a doctor diagnosed Matthew with noiseinduced hearing loss. The cause? Listening to his iPod at too high a volume.

A 2010 study at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston found that one in five teens suffers from some sort of hearing impairment-an increase of 33 percent since 1994. Most of that impairment was slight, but even a little trouble hearing can be a profound loss.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/115/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-03And today, we are exposed to a lot of noise.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/115/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-03If you think through your day, you'll realize that almost every moment is filled with sound, from the buzzing of your alarm clock to the cacophony of the cafeteria to the beeps and bloops of your video games. Most of this sound is harmless. But some is not. And one major source of dangerous noise may be stashed in your pocket or backpack right now. a personal media player-such as an iPod or phone-combined with a pair of earbuds.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/115/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-03For sound to damage hearing, two things must happen: The sound must be loud, and there must be a certain amount of exposure time. The louder the sound, the less time it takes to do damage. On the flip side, the longer the sound lasts, the less volume is needed to do harm.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/115/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-03Consider how your ears work: Your outer ear funnels sound into your eardrum, causing it to vibrate. Tiny sensory cells transmit the vibrations to your brain. Over time, loud noise can cause the cells to disintegrate. These cells do not heal, and they do not grow back.IMAGE PHOTOGRAPHSound is measured in units called decibels; anything above 85 decibels puts your ears at risk. Most MP3 players, like iPods, can hit 115 decibels. If you're listening with earbuds (versus over-the-ear headphones), it's even more likely that you're doing harm; earbuds have been found to increase volume by 5.5 decibels.

But once hearing is gone, it's not coming back. Hearing loss is permanent. It's also cumulative-so a slight loss at age 14 could put you on the path to needing a hearing aid by your 30s or 40s.

Have you ever walked out of a concert with your ears ringing? That ringing is a clear sign of damage. Rock concerts generally have decibel levels between 110 and 140-and sporting events can be just as loud. During the playoff game between the Seattle Seahawks and the New Orleans Saints last December, the noise level reached 137.6 decibels. Band practice, snowmobiles, sirens-all of these can damage your hearing too. Even your TV, if it's on loud enough and long enough, can lead to hearing loss.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/115/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-03Fortunately, you can do a lot to protect your ears. When using earbuds or headphones, ask a friend next to you whether he or she can hear your music. If the answer is yes, the music is dangerously loud. Always keep the volume at 70 percent or less. (iPods allow you to set a volume limit.) Another good idea is to invest in noise-canceling headphones: If you're not trying to drown out ambient sound, you won't be as tempted to crank up the volume. You can also use earplugs at concerts, sports games, and in other loud environments.

He has learned to cope with his hearing loss by doing things like sitting in the front row during class to ensure he can hear his professors. He says that turning the volume down or wearing earplugs "may seem ridiculous, but considering what I have been through... the alternative is worse." *

Mexican archaeologists recently announced that they had found the skeleton of a young woman surrounded by 1,789 human bones. The burial site was 15 feet below the surface, next to the remains of what seems to have been a sacred tree at one edge of the Templo Mayor, a key religious site in the ancient Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan.

According to University of Florida archaeologist Susan Gillespie, when the Maya did place sacrifice victims with royal burials, the victims were usually complete bodies. Between 1325 and 1521 (the time of the Spanish conquest of the area), the Aztecs, unlike other pre-Hispanic cultures, cremated members of the upper classes. "Although bodies of sacrificial victims have been found in burials of elite persons in Mesoamerica going back to at least the preclassic period [1500 B.C - A.D. 300], funerary deposits for Aztec elites have only rarely been encountered," says Gillespie.

Both are places where a heart removal ritual might leave a mark. It seems unlikely, however, that the victims were sacrificed on the spot because their bones were found separated. The skulls of seven adults and three children were found in one pile, long bones including femurs in another grouping, and ribs in another. The dig's director, Perta Ruiz, has suggested that the bones were disinterred from previous burials and reburied with the woman. Yet, it is unclear whether the Aztecs practiced this ritual.

At the same time, a majority of departments have experienced mandatory budget reductions, and most are in the midst of such reductions currently. The combination often leaves police administrators in a quandary of how to meet the ever-increasing state and federal requirements for in-service training while cutting budgetary spending. The answer could be as close as the computer in the squad room or training room.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-04The continued explosion of Internet-based services provides new opportunities in many facets for police departments. The technology and delivery methods behind e-learning in particular has experienced significant improvements and thereby growth in popularity and acceptance over the past few years. A Google&#174; search for "online police training" currently yields nearly 12 million results.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-04The upside to this is that the opportunities are clearly abundant; the downside is that training officials will have to do some navigating to find the best fit for their training needs. E-learning can encompass many different training modalities: online training, live Internet broadcasts, multi-media programs on CD or downloaded, interactive scenario-based training (FATS&#174; or driving simulators), or a combination of two or more of these techniques.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-04The concept of e-learning is not a new one. E-learning has been in place for more than a decade. As with many other technological advances, law enforcement is catching up to what has been used in the private sector and even the military for years. In university settings, the e-learning practice is well established. A study from the U.S. Department of Education found that during the 2006-2007 enrollment period that 66% of the two- and four-year colleges offered e-learning options. Distance education in colleges amounts to 12.2 million students this year.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-04In its infancy, the world of e-learning was approached cautiously and skeptically (if at all) and with good reason. Even police officers and their departments were not immune to the scams perpetuated by profiteers offering certifications or training credits for pay. Times have changed though in the cyber training world, and the fact is that there are many quality training opportunities by some well-regarded government agencies and private sector providers, including nonprofit groups.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-04Regardless of the cost savings and the convenience of online training, the big question for administrators and training officers should focus on the quality and effectiveness of the training. Police departments live under the all-too-familiar microscope of a litigation-happy society. Providing quality and accepted training to officers reduces the liability exposure and, more important, impmves officer safety. After all, the savings is a moot point if the objective of providing effective training is not reached.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-04An intensive study was conducted by Joyce Schmeeckle with the Journal of Science Education and Technology in September 2003. The journal article. "Online Training: An Evaluation of the Effectiveness and Efficiency of Ttaining Law Enforcement Personnel Over the Internet" reported on a study conducted with assistance from the Nebraska Law Enforcement Training Center.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-04The study involved jail management trainees assigned to either traditional classroom-type instruction or an Internet-based program. Following the )letion of the course, the level of effectiveness was measured by reviewing learning, motivation and attitudes. The efficiency of the program was measured using instructional time and cost / benefit calculations.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-04According to the results, the cl room group reported higher motivation and positive feelings concerning the instruction than did the online group. The bottom line, however, indicated that *'. . .online training is as effective an instructional method as classroom training, and more efficient than classroom training. No meaningful learning differences occurred between the two groups, but online training was completed in almost half the time of classroom instruction and at a lesser cost." This is a powerful statement when the ultimate goal of law enforcement training should be to reduce liability and increase officer and public safety by providing effective training to police officers.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-04The key to a successful e-learning program is determining which modality works best for the officer, administration, schedule and training goals. This may be determined by the type of training or the number of officers that the department wishes to train in the particular subject.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-04Blended Learning

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-04Blended learning is a widely accepted technique that works well for some topics requiring more face-to-face contact, feedback in a discussion format or hands-on training for some psychomotor skills. Blended learning incorporates a variety of learning styles into one class. Using this technique, an instructor could present a portion of a program in a discussion format to an entire class and then assign a unit through online learning for each officer to complete on an individual basis or vice versa.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-04An instructor could assign the first portion of a psychomotor skills program to be learned in an online format and follow up with face-to-face and hands-on instruction. This process allows the active feedback and discussion but can assign the bulk of the training workload to be learned at a student's own pace. The e-learning portion can be performed for designated periods during the work day to avoid overtime or scheduling conflicts.

There are four basic cate- . gories of online training providers: government agencies; nonprofit organizations; private organizations; and colleges and universities.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-04Government agencies: Many of the federal government agencies offer training in their respective areas of enforcement. The DEA offers drug training, the ATF offers training in explosives and fire investigation and so on. These providers rarely charge state / local police agencies for their training.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-04Nonprofit organizations: Many nonprofit organizations provide training to police agencies at no cost or at a very low price in an effort to further their organization's interest. The National Insurance Crime Bureau offers training in insurance fraud detection and accident investigation. Much like the government agencies, many of these organizations offer training to police agencies at little to no cost.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-04Private organizations: Thousands of companies offer law enforcement training to police agencies. Of course, these companies are "for profit" and therefore generally charge more than the first two groups for training. But this is not to say that they are not viable options. There are numerous companies that are well respected in the law enforcement community that offer high-quality training specific to a department's needs. Many companies will develop a customized program to fit the specific criteria that a department is looking for.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-04Colleges and universities: As with any other training provider, it is very likely that online college courses may be applied to in-service training. An increasing number of officers who did not attend college in a traditional setting after high school are electing to do so via distance education, fitting the classes into their often varying work schedules. The practice of major universities offering online courses has grown immensely over the years. This is an area where caution should be exercised to avoid new or start-up universities without a solid reputation.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-04Two schools that have well-established online curriculum are Bellevue University (www.bellevue.edu) and Kaplan University (www.kaplan.edu). Both of these schools have an established "brick and mortar" campus offering stability and a wide variety of online courses and degrees, and both are accredited by the Higher Learning Commission (www.ncahlc.org).

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-04Terms such as these are sometimes used liberally in regards to training. The best rule of thumb in regards to any descriptors such as "accredited," "certified" or "approved" is that they are only as good as the organization making the assertion. The terms themselves are somewhat ambiguous, realistically any of the terms could refer to approval by an organization that doesn't exist or that has nothing to do with the type of training. The fine print should indicate exactly what organization makes claims regarding the validity of any claims.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-04To date there is not a nationwide organization that "certifies," "approves" or "accredits" police training in one broad stroke. But of course, college courses are the exception. The process of determining whether or not the training is available for continuing education or in-service credits falls upon the training or standards governing body for each individual state. If inservice hours are the drive behind the training, then the agency that governs the accreditation or certification for that state should be contacted before committing to any agreements or making any purchases for law enforcement training.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-04Many states will allow its certified instructors in the field to make the determination and approve the training for credit hours as a facilitator. If the facilitator participates in the training and deems that it was valuable from an instructional standpoint, then accreditation or certification does not matter. Again, training staff should check with the appropriate state agency before taking any online training in regards to inservice credit.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-04Those officers seeking to earn or advance their college degree are almost always looking for college credits to add to their portfolio. It is possible to find providers on the private and government side of the fence that offer college credits as an option for some training. Keep in mind that in order to be accepted by the U.S. Department of Education, the provider must be a member of one of the approved accreditation organizations such as the Higher Learning Commission (www.ncahlc.org).

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-04In many cases, the training provider has partnered with an accredited college, which has reviewed and approved the training. The approving college will determine the amount of credit for each class, as well as the type of credit provided. In most cases, however, there is an additional fee for the college credit, which is payable to the college. If the college credits are beneficial to the officer, this may in many cases be a fair offer. If the officer intends to use a department tuition-reimbursement program to pay for the credits, that too should be approved ahead of time.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-04A great example of this college award process is demonstrated through the FEMA courses offered through the Federal Emergency Management Agency's Web site (www.fema.gov). Many of the FEMA courses are eligible for college credit through the Frederick Community College. Frederick is an accredited college through the Middle States Commission on Higher Education, recognized by the U.S. Department of Education. In order to receive credit, the student must pay $60 per semester hour to Frederick.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-04Diploma mills for online college degrees earned some unwelcome notoriety in the late '90s. Start-up online colleges, often with no real facilities, took the Internet by storm. Diploma mills sell college diplomas without the concern of providing any real education to the student. Diploma mills generally offer degrees that can be earned much more quickly than ordinarily possible, such as a four-year degree in a matter of months. Many times they offer more than reasonable credit for life experiences. These organizations will typically advertise with accreditations that sound realistic and impressive, but offer no real clout in the workplace.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-04Before making any commitment or paying any money to an online college, the institute's accreditation should be investigated through the U.S. Department of Education Web site (www.ed.gov). The old adage of "if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is" fits perfectly here. A college degree that requires little to no effort will provide little to no substance.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-04The costs associated with training in a traditional setting go far beyond the cost of the training course itself. Other factors that should be considered when calculating the cost of training include salary to provide shift coverage for the officer, overtime for schedule coverage and/or for the officer attending the training, per them expenses, meals, hotel or lodging costs, fuel to commute to training and mileage (wear and tear) on vehicles.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-04Pros and Cons

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-04Feedback from those who have participated in e-learning does offer some reported disadvantages to the concept. Some senior officers who are less familiar or comfortable with computer technology may be reluctant to take a leap of Internet faith in their training. Some officers expressed concern that in certain areas, the loss of the "hands on" option would be detrimental, such as with weapon retention or defensive tactics programs. Officers have also expressed that they prefer the ability to interact with others while participating in the training courses and that if there was a communication option with an instructor through the program that there may be a delay in receiving a response to questions.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-04Overall, however, the reported advantages outweighed the disadvantages. There is a significant cost savings with e-learning options, which may allow a department to train more officers, such as reserve or auxiliary officers, who otherwise would not receive the training. E-learning offers flexibility in the course for both the student and the training officers. Students generally have the option to work at their own pace and to do so without leaving home for days at a time. Ironically, officers generally complete the training in less time. Finally, officers who have had limited experience with computers will enhance their computer skills with the experience of taking the e-learning courses.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-04Since its inception, the Internet has brought about some wonderful advances and changes in how business and government conduct business. It has also brought about new opportunities for some to take advantage of the distance and somewhat anonymous nature of the World Wide Web to sell a bill of goods that doesn't measure up.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-04There should be no doubt that in certain situations online training can offer huge rewards to departments in their training efforts, saving manpower and costs. But each decision to use online training should be evaluated by training administrators regarding the source of the training and whether or not the e-learning delivery is a good option for the department needs and for the subject of the training.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-04If navigated well, departments can take advantage of some high-quality training for their officers. Training can be customized and blended to allow for the maximum learning potential, depending on the officers and the topics. The addition of e-learning to the training arsenal can increase training options, provide minimal adverse effects on the work schedule and bring immense savings to the training budget.SIDEBAROnline training is as effective as classroom training, and more efficient No learning differences.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/101/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-05Dr. Cosmetics is a dermatologist in a large U.S. city, and although he sees many general dermatology patients, the emphasis of his practice is on cosmetic dermatology.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/101/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-05Dr. Cosmetics finished his dermatology residency more than 20 years ago. Although he is board-certified in dermatology, he is not required to take the dermatology recertification examination. By his own admission, he is not at all up to date on the many subtleties of medical dermatology.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/101/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-05Dr. Cosmetics has staff privileges at his local community hospital in order to use the hospital-based lasers. He understands that inherent in having such privileges is the requirement of his being on call for dermatologie emergencies one month of each year.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/101/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-05During one of these on call periods, Dr. Cosmetics was called to see a patient in the emergency room.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/101/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-05He was told by the emergency room physician that the patient had a history of pemphigus vulgaris, was on immunosuppressive agents and presented with a high fever and weeping erosions over 70 percent of her body. Dr. Cosmetics told the physician that he was uncomfortable evaluating such a patient and suggested that the patient be placed in an ambulance and taken to the closest university hospital some 50 miles away. On the way to that hospital, the patient had a seizure and was intubated. She died three days later from what was later determined to be sepsis.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/101/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-05The surviving family brought a lawsuit against Dr. Cosmetics alleging that but for his negligence in refusing to see the patient, she might not have died. Dr. Cosmetics contends he cannot be sued because no physician-patient relationship was established between him and the severely ill patient. Is he correct?

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/101/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-05A recent Kansas case (seeber v. Ebeling) raised the very same question.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/101/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-05In that case, the defendant neurosurgeon asked whether his refusal to come to the emergency room established enough of a physician-patient relationship to lead to a malpractice case. In the Kansas case, the plaintiff was injured in an automobile accident and suffered a spinal cord injury and fractures to his neck. The injured patient was airlifted to a local hospital and upon arrival was unable to move his hands and legs. The local emergency room physician evaluated him and determined that he needed neurosurgical care. Over two hours later the neurosurgeon on call (Dr. Ebeling) was paged.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/101/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-05Dr. Ebeling was told of the patient's history and all relevant performed studies. Dr. Ebeling was also told that the patient had a spinal cord injury and a cervical spine fracture. The defendant neurosurgeon explained to the emergency room doctor that he was exhausted and would not come to the emergency room. He suggested that the patient be transferred to the university medical center.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/101/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-05Ultimately, the completely paraplegic plaintiff filed suit against Dr. Ebeling, contending that the medical care provided by Dr. Ebeling was negligent. Dr. Ebeling contended that he did not owe the plaintiff a duty of care because he had refused to see him as a patient. The Kansas court, like most state courts, premised its analysis on the fact that the duty of care in a medical malpractice action against a physician was based on the existence of a physician-patient relationship. The Kansas court ruled that if the doctor never provided any care, treatment or advice concerning the patient's condition, the requirement of establishing a physician-patient relationship had not been met. Since there was no evidence that the defendant neurosurgeon had provided any advice concerning treatment on the phone, no physician-patient relationship had been established.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/101/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-05Although some jurisdictions have considered the on call agreement between a physician and his/her hospital enough to establish a physician-patient relationship between the patient in the emergency room and the on call doctor, most courts rule in a similar manner to the Kansas court.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/101/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-05Dr. Cosmetics will likely be dropped as a defendant in the medical malpractice case brought against him.SIDEBARSome jurisdictions have considered the on call agreement between a physician and his/her hospital enough to establish a physicianpatient relationship between the patient in the emergency room and the on call doctor.SIDEBARDr. Cosmetics told the physician that he was uncomfortable evaluating such a patient and suggested that the patient be placed in an ambulance and taken to the closest university hospital.AUTHOR_AFFILIATIONDavid, Goldberg, M.D., J.D.

But the Wall is not forgotten.Byline: Zofia SmardzEdition: OnlineSection: TRAVELType: News

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/105/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-05It's taking forever to get to my friend Tony's apartment. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/105/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-05 It's been 25 minutes at least since we got on the U-Bahn in Berlin's Mitte district, and still the subway stops keep coming -- Potsdamer Platz, Gleisdreieck, Bulow Strasse. Aargh. We're going to be so late, I think, listening with one ear to the Valley Girl chatter of the 20-somethings across the aisle and wondering where all these American kids in the city are coming from. Not to mention the Swedes and the Poles and the Frenchies and Spaniards and Israelis and Russians. And all the ones whose languages I can't identify. It's a veritable mini-U.N. here in Germany's capital. Amazing. Next stop, Zoologischer Garten. Four more to go. Oh man, it's going to be 40 minutes before we get there. We should have left earlier. Why is this taking so long? It never took this long to get around before. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/105/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-05 Well, of course it didn't. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/105/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-05 That's because "before" was more than a quarter-century ago, when the Berlin I knew was half the size it is today. You know, in the days of the infamous Wall, which cleft the occupied city in two and turned West Berlin into an island of freedom in a communist sea. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/105/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-05 West Berlin was Berlin back then. "I'm going to Berlin," I'd say - - just Berlin -- whenever my reporting job sent me there from the West German capital of Bonn. And that other half-city, over the wall? That wasn't Berlin. That was East Berlin, a forbidding fortress of a place, gray and lifeless, brooding and dull.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/105/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-05 Our Berlin, by contrast, was bright and shiny, chic and fashionable. I'd flit up and down the Kurfurstendamm, the elegant shopping avenue, and have lunch at the Hotel Kempinski and shop at the famous department store KaDeWe, and sometimes I'd head to Checkpoint Charlie for a quick incursion into the East. (And hold my breath until I got back out.)

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/105/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-05 And now it's been 25 years -- exactly 25 on Nov. 9 -- and it's all just one big, sprawling city, open and free and exhilarating, construction booming and change all over the place. But hoo-boy, it has. Taken. So. Long. to get across town, from our hotel in the former East Berlin to Tony's place in Charlottenburg, the heart of the former West. And I'm wondering, as we get off the U-Bahn (which couldn't even run this far back then) and make our way down the leafy streets, do people even think of the city that way anymore? You know, here it used to be East Berlin, and here it used to be West. Do they remember the Wall?

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/105/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-05 I can't believe it. There's a circus at Checkpoint Charlie. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/105/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-05 By which I mean, Checkpoint Charlie is a circus. Well, what used to be Checkpoint Charlie. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/105/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-05 There's a big crowd milling around in the street at the intersection of Friedrichstrasse and Zimmerstrasse. Tourists are streaming in and out of the souvenir shops surrounding the little booth that stands on the spot where American MPs used to check my papers whenever I crossed into East Berlin. It's not real -- just a replica of the original guard booth that stood here in 1961, when the wall first went up. (Naturally -- you want to play up the most dramatic historical moment.) 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/105/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-05 It comes complete with a stack of sandbags, a copy of the original sign ominously warning, "You are leaving the American sector" (the real one's in the nearby House at Checkpoint Charlie Museum) -- and actors in military uniform who'll gladly pose for a photo with you. For only -- I squint to read the laminated sheets dangling from their waists -- "2 euro; 3 $U.S." 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/105/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-05 Sheesh. This is a little cheesy, no? Here? At the former gateway to grimness? 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/105/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-05 Oh, what a melodramatic party poop I'm being. That was then! This is now, and now, there's no shortage of takers for those photos. My husband and I watch a steady stream of folks join the two handsome phony young guards with their rifles -- a young blond woman, a couple of kids who strike a thumbs-up pose, two giggling and grinning teenage girls. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/105/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-05 Lots of other people just click away from the sidelines. They're all going to end up with the same photo of -- hmm. A fake Checkpoint Charlie. But hey, better a fake one than a real one, don't you think? And you know, all the photogs seem pretty happy with it. Like they're celebrating, even. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/105/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-05 As well they should be. This is a place that keeps the Wall's demise alive, and there's an air of revelry all along Zimmerstrasse approaching the checkpoint intersection. "Curry at the Wall" shouts a big sign topped by a Berlin bear holding up a giant sausage, advertising the city's signature street food, currywurst (sausage covered in curry-infused ketchup). As we pass the Trabant museum, a couple of the little rattletrap East German cars, painted in kooky neon patterns, come tootling down the road. They're back from a tour, the drivers going "honk, honk" on the tinny horns and waving like celebrities. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/105/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-05 Man, what a tourist trap. Capitalism with a capital C.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/105/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-05 We walk up in the morning through Prenzlauer Berg, which was Dissident Central in the East German days. Then, it was dark and gray and empty, the prewar buildings still pockmarked with bullet holes. I was stalked by the Stasi -- the East German secret police - - here. But now it's prettily spruced up and cheery in the August sunlight, and the idea that someone would be following you with suspicious intent is just ridiculous. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/105/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-05 As we arrive at the memorial stretch where the Wall stood, I hear a tour guide across the street: "So over here was West, and over there was East," he says. Aha! 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/105/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-05 I'm standing in what was East Berlin, on the now-grassy ground of the former "death strip" behind the Wall, staring at the side of a building adorned with the gigantic blow-up of one of the most famous photos of an East-to-West escape -- a helmeted East German soldier leaping over barbed wire into freedom in 1961. Happened just a little ways from here. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/105/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-05 Behind me, a German mother is explaining a relief model of the Wall and the area to her young children. Well, sort of. "See, these are buildings, and these are the streets," she's saying, leaving out the Wall. Oh well, her kids are so young, anyway. Probably they're all just out for a stroll on a lovely day. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/105/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-05 We walk along the route of the Wall, which is marked by a row of upright metal rods, past young girls turning cartwheels on the grass, blithely oblivious to the past. But my husband is fascinated by all the round metal "coins" in the sidewalk that commemorate East Berliners' escape attempts -- successful and not so -- over the decades. (There were so many.) 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/105/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-05 We pass the modernist Reconciliation Chapel, built in 1999 on the site of the 19th-century Reconciliation Church that the East Germans blew up in 1985 (just four years before the end!). And then there it is -- a preserved section of wall. My husband shoots a few snaps of me in front of it (it rises straight from the sidewalk and towers above my head), and then we cross the street and climb up an observation tower to look down on the re-created death strip behind the gray concrete. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/105/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-05 Yup, that's what it looked like -- dirt and barbed wire and a watchtower, and on the far side, another wall. It's a scene I saw lots of times in years gone by.

A strutting little behatted green "go" figure has just taken the place of his arms- spread-wide red "stop" counterpart. "That's so cute." 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/105/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-05 "Oh yeah, that's Ampelmannchen," says Tony, a British journo friend from all those years ago who's never left Berlin. "He's Eastern, you know. Just about the only Eastern thing that's been adopted citywide. It's the only thing they won out on." 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/105/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-05 Ah, yes. After the Wall came down, the West with all its glitz and money invaded the East and took over, and the poor Ossis, or East Berliners, felt overrun and overwhelmed. It's nice that at least one Ossi creation has united and conquered. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/105/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-05 It helps that he's so adorable. In fact, Berlin's official bear mascot had better watch out: A couple of days after I notice Ampelmann (that's "traffic-light man" in German), we're on our way to busy Alexanderplatz (the "hub" of East Berlin, where I hardly ever saw a soul in the "before" days), and there right on the main drag is a whole store devoted to the little fellow! I can't resist. I stock up on Ampelmann gummis and T-shirts and place mats and mugs as my husband grouses, "I can't believe they have a whole store devoted to a traffic light." But of course they do. It's capitalism! 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/105/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-05 And it's moving across the East. There's construction and cranes everywhere. In the Mitte district, the formerly forlorn heart of Berlin that was mostly trapped behind the Wall, they've kept the massive communist-built TV tower on Alexanderplatz. But down on Unter den Linden, the Kempinski chain has rebuilt the ruined Hotel Adlon as a five-star celeb center. ("That's the Michael Jackson hotel!" says a breathless bicycle tour guide. Referring, no doubt, to the infamous episode when the late singer dangled his infant son from a hotel window.) And the huge, boxy presidential palace that the communists built after razing the war-damaged royal Hohenzollern palace is -- outta there! To be replaced by . . . a replica of the Hohenzollern palace. Oh, the irony. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/105/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-05 And Berliners know from irony. "If we didn't have the Wall and the TV tower and the Brandenburg Gate, there'd be no tourism in Berlin," says Frank Barleben, pedaling us in his velotaxi down to the East Side Gallery (another preserved section of Wall, this one covered in artists' murals). He gives me a wink. "Do you think Walter Ulbricht" -- the East Geman president who ordered up the Wall in 1961 -- "thought of that?" 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/105/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-05 No, I bet he did not. Nor do I imagine that he imagined a museum of East German motorcycles. And a store that sells East German products (scratchy dish towels, anyone? -- although, I do have to get a couple of these matchbox-size Trabis for the nephews). And the interactive DDR Museum, which is jampacked when we visit. I'm crushed in a line inching its way through the first exhibits toward the noisy Trabant in the corner. No way I'm going to get a chance to "drive" it, though, given that crowd of kids pressed up around the cardboard on wheels, as it was known. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/105/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-05 And what's with all the kids? Do they even know what DDR stands for? (That would be Deutsche Demokratische Republik, the official German name for East Germany.) Maybe not, but they're all over the place, fighting to weigh themselves on the scale in the model East Berlin apartment (careful, the phone's tapped), and sitting behind the big bureaucrat's desk in the office space, and peering into the ersatz dissident's prison cell with its spare bed and toilet.

(In fact, the place had a role in the 2006 movie "The Lives of Others.") But this was no movie.

The Nazis are famously believed to have burned it in 1933, then blamed the communists and other "troublemakers" so that they could consolidate their power. In 1945, it was seized by the occupying Soviet troops, who planted their flag on the ruined roof. After the Wall went up, just yards away, it sort of sat there, just an occasionally used West Berlin event and exhibit space. But when the Wall fell, it was the scene of joyous, triumphal celebration.

I never would have thought I'd be sitting here in a glitzy contemporary restaurant, chowing down on a fine meal and enjoying the panoramic views of Berlin, which will be even better when we get to the top of the glass dome that now crowns the building. Which is, of course, our after-dinner plan.

That dome's a big attraction; I can see the people snaking their way up and down the ramps to the top. My favorite factoid from our sightseeing bus tour: The dome's glass represents transparency in government, and the visitors walking inside it show that the people are above the government. (Take that, East Germany. Oh right, you don't exist anymore.)

I'm thinking this as we stand in the dome and stare at that monument, all lit up and glowing in the dark below. I bet all those young people we see there every day, crowding the Pariser Platz like a German Times Square and gabbling in their cacophony of tongues, don't give it a second thought.

These limitations will have to be developed in the concrete factual circumstances of individual cases. . . . Suffice it to note that such a search, unlike a search without a warrant incident to a lawful arrest, is not justified by any need to prevent the disappearance or destruction of evidence of crime. See Preston v. United States, 376 U.S. 364, 367 (1964). The sole justification of the search in the present situation is the protection of the police officer and others nearby, and it must therefore be confined in scope to an intrusion reasonably designed to discover guns, knives, clubs, or other hidden instruments for the assault of the police officer.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/105/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-05The scope of the search in this case presents no serious problem in light of these standards. Officer McFadden patted down the outer clothing of petitioner and his two companions. He did not place his hands in their pockets or under the outer surface of their garments until he had felt weapons, and then he merely reached for and removed the guns. He never did invade Katz' person beyond the outer surfaces of his clothes, since he discovered nothing in his pat-down which might have been a weapon. Officer McFadden confined his search strictly to what was minimally necessary to learn whether the men were armed and to disarm them once he discovered the weapons. He did not conduct a general exploratory search for whatever evidence of criminal activity he might find.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/105/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-05We conclude that the revolver seized from Terry was properly admitted in evidence against him. At the time he seized petitioner and searched him for weapons, Officer McFadden had reasonable grounds to believe that petitioner was armed and dangerous, and it was necessary for the protection of himself and others to take swift measures to discover the true facts and neutralize the threat of harm if it materialized. The policeman carefully restricted his search to what was appropriate to the discovery of the particular items which he sought. Each case of this sort will, of course, have to be decided on its own facts. We merely hold today that where a police officer observes unusual conduct which leads him reasonably to conclude in light of his experience that criminal activity may be afoot and that the persons with whom he is dealing may be armed and presently dangerous, where in the course of investigating this behavior he identifies himself as a policeman and makes reasonable inquiries, and where nothing in the initial stages of the encounter serves to dispel his reasonable fear for his own or others' safety, he is entitled for the protection of himself and others in the area to conduct a carefully limited search of the outer clothing of such persons in an attempt to discover weapons which might be used to assault him. Such a search is a reasonable search under the Fourth Amendment, and any weapons seized may properly be introduced in evidence against the person from whom they were taken.

They do not need a warrant, but within 48 hours after an arrest made without an arrest warrant, they must bring the person who has been arrested before a judge. The police may conduct an inventory search of any luggage or bags the arrested person has with him or her, but this procedure must be performed consistently. In other words, everything must be subject to the same inventory search. An inventory search cannot be used with some people and not with other people.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-05AMERICAN DARK COMEDY: BEYOND SATIRE By Wes. D. Gehring. Westport, CT: Greenwood, 1996. 194 pp. $55.00 cloth. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-05Wes Gehring is one of our most prolific and instructive writers on film comedy. His books on Chaplin, Fields, the Marx Brothers, and screwball comedy are indispensable. In this study he places "dark" film comedy-work with grim and violent humor-in the context of "black humor" more broadly, and he takes a closer look at several important examples of the genre. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-05Gehring's first chapter is a "historical and literary overview" that attempts to establish contexts for dark comedy in Western literature from Aristophanes to the postmodernists and in historical and philosophic perspectives that might account for its point of view and its appeal. Frankly, the chapter is a disappointment. It is much too brief and superficial. Gehring is correct in noting that dark comedy did not just emerge out of nowhere in the post-World War II cultural environment. It can be traced back to cynical and ironic views of life, particularly the comic potential of juxtaposing violence and the grotesque with a refusal to take them seriously or to be unduly saddened by them. Such attitudes can be found as far back as we have written records, and they seem to be rather universal. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-05The overview jumps around chronologically, across genres-from Darwin and Freud to the significance of the Holocaust to American literary examples from the nineteenth century to the present-but basically Gehring mentions rather than explores or develops any of the topics. He does not provide the reader with a careful, well-organized, sustained treatment of the relationship between dark comedy and irony and cynicism-the differences between viewing the world as meaningless or absurd and using humor as a coping mechanism to deal with a horrifying world. His survey of authors should be longer and more detailed; many readers know the references and understand how Melville or Twain might be considered "dark humorists," but others might not, and besides it is the critic and historian's obligation to show the analysis as well as the conclusion. We need a discussion of the specific nature of post-World War II dark humor: How does it differ from earlier examples? How is postmodernism different from existentialism in presenting a world that is absurd and even incomprehensible? What are all of the possible motives and functions of comedy in such a world? Gehring hints at answers to some of these questions, but in a chapter that covers so much ground in thirteen-and-a-half pages that the results are inevitably not satisfying. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-05The book also covers a lot of ground in the film history of dark comedy, but here Gehring provides enough detail to make his points. He touches on some very early examples in Chaplin, Keaton, Hawkes, Lubitsch, and Capra, providing at lest a paragraph devoted to a particular film or two of each director. For the post-1960s he jumps around chronologically again; the cuts from one film reference to another seem to me to be jarring, but perhaps the more cinematically literate will find it easier to follow. For example, a discussion of Dr. Strangelove (1964) introduced in the beginning of chapter 2 is developed more fully later in one about Little Big Man ( 1970) and Natural Born Killers (1994), without any clear explanation of the bases for comparison. We consider the cold war and the fear of mass extermination, genocide, and senseless murder, with major references to sex laced throughout, and it just doesn't quite jell. Although it is not hard to see how these fit into the dark comedy definition, it is difficult to follow how all of the references fit together. This structure is made even more difficult by the close focus on Groucho Marx and Charlie Chaplin in chapter 3, after it seemed as though we had moved on to relatively contemporary examples. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-05Chapter 4, "Coming of Age . . . with a Vengence," is somewhat easier to understand. It adequately discusses Harold and Maude (1971), Heathers (1989), and Natural Born Killers (1994) as treatments of coming to grips with violence, evil, and absurdity as part of the maturation process. Given more space to discuss the particular films, Gehring is at his best, relating technical and "film biz" insights to thematic and cultural analyses. Chapter 5 similarly offers a useful discussion of film noir and dark comedy. A brief conclusion returns to the issues introduced in the first chapter but adds little to resolve the discussion. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-05Wes Gehring has written on an important subject, and much of what he has to say, particularly about the films themselves and the filmmakers, is enlightening. American Dark Comedy is surely worth reading. It will be a contribution to a larger literature that is emerging and developing on the artistic and philosophic relationship among comedy and violence, horror, the grotesque, and the absurd.

But she hits the snooze button four times before getting out of bed. She tells herself she'll study during lunch. She spends time looking for her missing gym clothes, so she's late for school. In English class she finds out that a report was due that she didn't even know about. After school, her mom takes her and her little sister shopping for shoes. There go two more hours! After dinner she talks to her best friend for an hour about what a terrible day it's been. Sarah decides to start her homework at 10 p.m. Too bad her math book is still at school. At 11 p.m. she gives up and turns on the TV to watch a rerun. She wails, "I didn't get anything done today." Tomorrow, she promises herself, will be different.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-05According to Dr. Robert Arnot, author of The Biology of Success, "Rituals are the foundation of success." He advocates turning every part of your life--sleep, meals, exercise, when and how you work-into a ritual. His point is that anything you can make into a habit or do as a routine frees your brain from worrying. Worrying uses up energy better spent on the work you need to get done.

The key is to get started: Pick the smallest step, the easiest piece, or the part that appeals to you. If worst comes to worst, set a timer for 20 minutes and get to work. Just start!

Chronobiologists (scientists who study biological rhythms) have identified 11 am.-1 p.m. and 4 p.m.-6 p.m. as times of peak energy for most people, but you need to discover your own biorhythms. Do the easy stuff when you're tired, says Arnot, and "don't waste high-energy time on low-energy jobs." If you must work past your peak time, say Eisenberg and Kelly, take a refresher break-- go for a walk, stretch, phone someone who cheers you up.

It helps us set goals and work harder. It makes us pay bills, finish projects and perform well on exams. But when it's overwhelming, it becomes "distress," and then it can be debilitating. She says stress occurs when there is an imbalance between the demands upon us and the resources at our disposal.

Other times it's not so obvious. Stress is usually caused by change, though. So look for changes - big or small - in your life that might be unsettling. Look back to when the symptoms started.

This is one of the most important questions to ask, Szabo says. Often a lack of confidence will undermine a person's ability to cope with a stressful situation. Sometimes we bring undue stress upon ourselves by engaging in negative thinking, Szabo points out.

Breathe deeply, relax. Both help mitigate the physical symptoms of stress, like increased heart rate, blood pressure and respiration. Getting some exercise has been shown to be useful, too, and research has shown that a relaxed state usually follows a period of physical ACTIVITY.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-05Some 5,000 years ago, ancient Britons erected a vast circular embankment between the low hills of Englands Salisbury Plain. A few centuries later, after several spurts of additional construction, a central circle of -10-ton upright stones stood capped by 10-ton horizontal "lintels." This is Stonehenge, one of the greatest achievements of prehistoric Europeans.

Stonehente and its brethren clearly wore important. They often show evidence of astronomical alignments. Hut how many of these alignments were deliberaldy desinged into the monuments? Were they, in any meaningful sense. Stone Age observatories? What answers scientists can give to these questions haven't come easily.

Batchelor points to the outer circle of large upright stones, the so-called sarsen circle. The builders of Stonehenge, he says, moved these stones from quarries up to 25 miles (40 kilometers) away.

"These are the ones that come from the Preseli Mountains in southwest Wales," Batchelor explains, referring to a mountain range more than 150 miles (240 km) away. One can only imagine the effort required to drag so many massive stones such an enormous distance.

Hundreds of equally ancient stone structures, known as "megaliths," occur across Britain, Ireland, and northwestern Europe. A few sites, such as nearby Avebury and Callanish in northwestern Scotland, rival Stonehenge in size and sophistication.

Perhaps the most commonly expounded theory - and the one that has taken root most deeply in the popular imagination is the notion that these monuments were astronomical observatories used to help track the motions of the Sun, Moon, and stars. This claim always has been controversial. It's enlightening to compare the rather cautious reflections of archaeologists and archaeoastronomers today with the often wild speculations of earlier decades.

The monument's largest stones are arranged in an arc at the very center. They consist of five enormous "trilithons," each made from two massive uprights and capped with a horizontal lintel. They're laid out like a horseshoe, with the axis of symmetry lying along a southwest-northeast line.

The axis also passes by an outlying rock - the so-called "heel stone" - to the monument's northeast.

This basic alignment seems beyond dispute. But Batchelor says scholars continue to debate whether the monument's builders worshipped at midsummer, midwinter, or both.

Even the areas older structures, such as the "long barrow" tombs that pepper the surrounding countryside, typically display a solar orientation, albeit a less precise one. Most align east-west, with the entrance pointing roughly east. But the actual angles cover such a wide range that some scholars suggest they reflect a lunar, rather than a solar, orientation.

A narrow passageway stretches some 80 feet (24 meters) inside. At the tomb's far end, three small alcoves branch off from the main passage. On the morning of the winter solstice, sunlight streams through a small opening above the main entrance and illuminates the back of the tomb.

He investigated Newgrange's geometry in the 1980s. Today, on the solstice, several minutes pass between sunrise and the first penetration of light into the tomb. This delay is the result of changes in Earth's axial tilt over the past 5,000 years. When Newgrange was built, Ray explains, the summ er-solstice Sun would light the passageway exactly at dawn. There's no question the solar alignment was the intention of its builders, he says.

That's certainly possible - such claims hardly can be disproven - but the evidence is much less clear than with the solstices.

Archaeologist and archaeoastronomer Clive Ruggles, now retired from the University of Leicester, wrote that it "forms one of the most notorious examples known to archeologists of an age recreating the past in its own image." He added that there is "no reason whatsoever to suppose that at any stage the site functioned as an astronomical observatory - at least in any sense that would be meaningful to a modern astronomer."

Certain stones may be aligned with certain astronomical phenomena, but what evidence is there that such alignments are more than mere flukes? With enough stones and enough celestial "targets" - the rising or setting position of a particular bright star, for example - alignments become inevitable. As archaeologist Aubrey Burl, retired from Hull College of Higher Education, wrote: "Statistically, the odds are in favour of a good celestial sight-line occurring fortuitously in almost any circle."

Dramatically situated on a cliff on the Isle of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides, the location may have been chosen "because it allows the viewing of a dramatic interaction between the landscape and the movements of the Moon," says archaeologist Patrick Ashmore of Historic Scotland, the agency responsible for the monument. He believes people gathered at the site at intervals of 18 Â½ years, when the Moon would have reached its southernmost sky position.

Remarkably, that phenomenon is mentioned by the Greek historian Diodorus, in reference to a "spherical temple" somewhere in Britain. But, as usual, the evidence is ambiguous: There's no way to know if Diodorus was referring to Callanish, and no proof the Pleiades alignment is anything more than a geometric quirk.

As with Stonehenge, the circles main axis often is claimed to be aligned with the Sun's solstice position. Yet, southwest Ireland hosts some 50 stone circles, and none of them shares this alignment.

But he's more interested in the relationship between the monument and the surrounding landscape. The design, he says, may be largely symbolic, inspired as much by the "sacred geography" of the region as by the sky.

The areas many burials suggest this. Neolithic peoples also may have paused to honor the Sun and Moon, and to mark the seasons. Such activities involved the motions of heavenly bodies, but did not require precise observations.

But Aveni suggests it isn't necessary. Stonehenge, he writes, is best thought of "as a place of social gathering, of religious assembly, as a cultic center, as a place of fortified habitations, a celestial temple, and observatory."

Aveni agrees they may well have tracked celestial bodies.

References to music, history, philosophy, and art formed a key part W of the Nazi strategy to reverse the symptoms of ^ decline perceived after World War I. Allusions to great creators and their works were used as propaganda to remind the Volk to love and worship their nation. In the words of the French scholar Eric Michaud, author of The Cult of Art in Nazi Germany, the Nazis used culture "to make the genius of the race visible to that race." And to cap off these images of a great national culture, the Nazis heralded Adolf Hitler, the Führer, as an artistic leader.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-05As Michaud put it: "Hitler presented himself not only as a 'man of the people' and a soldier with frontline experi-ence (Fronterlebnis), but also and above all as a man whose artistic experience constituted the best guarantee of his ability to mediate the Volksgeist and turn it into the 'perfect Third Reich.'"

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-05The revival of a culturally rich Germany as the so-called Third Reich, however, would be achieved only once those whom the Nazis considered its enemies were all destroyed. So war and culture went together in the National Socialist agenda. Art, said Hitler's propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels, "is no mere peacetime amusement, but a sharp spiritual weapon for war."

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-05To understand how Nazis employed culture to define and promote their broadest ambitions, I looked to German mass media, in particular the main Nazi newspaper, the Völkischer Beobachter, whose cultural pages I examined for the years 1920 to 1945. While the Nazi co-optation of many great figures in the Western intellectual tradition during these eventful years proves revealing, one need look no further than the party's claim on Friedrich Nietzsche to see how culture became entwined in the discourse of politics and war in the pages of Hitler's foremost propaganda outlet.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-05Fitting Nietzsche's ideas into a single worldview was no simple matter, but this was precisely the mission of the Völkischer Beobachter's editors and writers: to make even complex ideas such as Nietzsche's appear to coordinate with the main tenets of Nazism. Looking into the shifting terms with which the daily newspaper presented Nietzsche helps us toward understanding how the Nazi party attempted to place his biography and writings-along with the tradition of Kultur as a whole-at the service of the Nazi outlook.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-05In addressing the "Germanness" of Nietzsche, however, the cultural politicians of the party faced some difficulties. The newspaper did not try to verify Nietzsche's racial origins-as it did for many other Western creators, including and especially Wagner and Beethoven-despite the fact that he occasionally claimed to be of Polish heritage. But it did have to confront indications that the philosopher rejected nineteenth-century trends of nationalistic identification.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-05As one contributor to the Völkischer Beobachter wrote, there is "one important point in Nietzsche's mental atti- tude on which even his friends have remained silent, from which they tried to distance themselves as much as possible: this is the matter of Nietzsche's attitude toward Germanness and the state." The philosopher, according to the paper, had seen with "sharp eyes" that while the Second Reich had been formed, it still "remained a shell without content" under Otto von Bismarck's Realpolitik. To him, nationalism was the "illness of the century" because it "attempted to hide its emptiness." In his words, "Nationalism as it is understood today is a dogma that requires limitation."

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-05But the point to keep in mind, according to the Völkischer Beobachter, was the qualifying phrase: "as it is understood today." Nietzsche's opinions about the German state could be understood only with reference to this phrase-that is, as critiques of his own specific time, not as categorical rejections of German nationalism.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-05This opened the way for the newspaper to present Nietzsche as a fervent patriot and strong representative of "Germanness." In fact, the paper reminded, Nietzsche actually said of himself that "I am perhaps more German than the Germans of today." And he valued the "earnest, manly, stern, and daring German spirit." He knew that "there was still bravery, particularly German bravery," that is, "inwardly something different than the élan of our deplorable neighbors." Compared with the French essence, in particular, he was "consistently, strongly, and happily conscious of the virtues" of the German character. Above all, Nietzsche held that "it is German unity in the highest sense which we are striving for more passionately than for political reunification-the unity of the German spirit and life."

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-05Very few others "saw things so clearly" in those days, said the Völkischer Beobachter. As if on a mission to confirm the philosopher's Germanness, another contributor traveled to Sils-Maria, wandered the region, and ruminated on passages Nietzsche had written there. The landscape, Ernst Nickell reflected, is "consecrated by German fate and German tragedy." Nietzsche "needed this landscape; he had to stand near the highest things and the firmament"-because he was "German despite everything."

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-05Nietzsche was, however, rather ambivalent about politics, having called himself the "last anti-political German of them all." But Nazi propaganda rigorously promoted the view that the primary creative impulse was as much political as it was artistic. The picture of Nietzsche thus had to be corrected to bring out his political side.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-05The Völkischer Beobachter admitted that "we find here at first view a sharp contrast with today's [National Socialist] thinking"-but only at first glance. According to the paper, what Nietzsche understood by the term "state" was completely different from "our idea of the state today." For him, politicization meant democratization, i.e., the greatest good for the greatest number. This Nietzsche hated, the paper said, because "general prosperity would make mankind too lazy to invest powerful energy in a great individual- in a genius." That is why Nietzsche wanted "as little state as possible." A volkish state, directed according to Nazi ideology, however, would revive the genius of the nation, and therefore earn Nietzsche's support.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-05The paper acknowledged that Nietzsche had other views that seemed "the complete opposite of our views today." For instance, he viewed culture and the state as antagonists. This, perhaps, should have made him the oddest of conscripts to the Nazi campaign to subordinate culture to politics and war, but that was not the party line. Such ideas of Nietzsche's, the Völkischer Beobachter insisted, were likewise conditioned by his own times:

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-05The German Reich had had the misfortune to achieve its external form when there was no longer any inner content. The classical heights of German education had sunk, the song of German Romanticism sounded only from afar. On the other hand, Realism was on the rise, leading more and more toward materialism. Money and business had become the gods of the age.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-05A state as the "guardian and defender of culture; a state as the means of achieving the true goal of existence, not as a goal in itself; a state that is built on the Volk- that, Nietzsche would have accepted," the newspaper claimed. Therefore, the philosopher "would have agreed with today's [National Socialist] German idea of the state with all of his heart."

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-05Under the Weimar Republic, the Völkischer Beobachter complained, Nietzsche had been invoked far too frequently by "international-democratic literati" as a "star-witness" for their worldview. But, the paper countered, Nietzsche "hated and fought every form of democracy, both political and spiritual," and he said so in the sharpest possible terms. The notions that "all are the same" and that at base we are all just selfish brutes and riffraff-were symbolic of the democratic age that believed in the equality of men and that established "the weak, fat, and cowardly as standards for this equality."

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-05In Nietzsche's opinion, said the Völkischer Beobachter, this rule of the humble amounted to a blow against life itself. Against the democratic and supposedly feeble outlook of the Weimar era, the newspaper argued, Nietzsche set forth a way of thinking that sets laws for the futurean outlook which "handled contemporary things harshly and tyrannically" in the interest of the future.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-05Thus did the cultural-historical material that appeared in the Völkischer Beobachter resound with the Führer/ArtistArtist/Führer theme that typified Nazi cultural politics. Hitler was the primary manifestation of this creative leadership, but he came, according to this view, after a long line of notable predecessors, including Luther, Beethoven, Wagner, and, yes, Nietzsche.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-05Cultural renewal in accordance with such perceptions of intellectual history was a central premise of the larger project of the Third Reich, fundamental to Hitler's aims. But this agenda also contributed to the most destructive impulses of the movement. Indeed, German cultural identity as shaped by the Nazi regime did not merely justify anti-Semitism or policies of extermination, it led to them. Hitler's racist standards of judgment were grounded in cultural terms, as he stated in Mein Kampf : "If we were to divide mankind into three groups, the founders of culture, the bearers of culture, the destroyers of culture, only the Aryan could be considered as the representative of the first group." According to the Völkischer Beobachter, Jewish creators such as Heine, Meyerbeer, Mendelssohn, Mahler, and Schoenberg-among many others-supposedly belonged in the latter, so they and their kind had to be eradicated.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-05Demonstrating that great cultural figures of the past would have agreed with these premises was a priority in the Nazi newspaper. One contributor put it in these stark terms: "to win over to our movement spiritual leaders who think they see something distasteful in anti-Semitism, it is extremely important to present more and more evidence that great, recognized spirits shared our hatred of Jewry."

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-05In the case of Nietzsche, however, this process required a little more "spin" than the "selective scavenging" for biographical and textual evidence that scholar Steven Aschheim identified as the usual mode of such politicization. Some Völkischer Beobachter contributors recognized that Nietzsche had not been a committed anti-Semite, and had even criticized the anti-Semitic views of Richard Wagner, his own sister, Elisabeth, and her husband, Bernhard Förster. One editor, for instance, said about Nietzsche: "His work contains other crass contradictions and obscurities, especially in his treatment of the Jewish Question, where he sometimes confesses himself as an Anti-Semite, and then as a philo-Semite. Equally obscure is what he understood as race and nation. This may be a result of the eruptive nature of his creativity and the shortness of his life, which didn't allow him enough time to go into these issues deeply."

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-05But other contributors wrote as if aligning Nietzschean ideas with Nazi anti-Semitism posed no difficulties at all. One article listed carefully selected passages from Beyond Good and Evil to show that Nietzsche "expressed himself extraordinarily farsightedly on the Jewish Question." An article entitled "Nietzsche as Warner about the Jewish Danger" insisted that Nietzsche concerned himself with the Jewish Question, "as every clear thinking, every sensitive Aryan-German person must." Nietzsche, the paper said, recognized the danger threatening Germans in the form of a completely foreign and utterly different race, and "warned us-and like so many hundreds of great, significant men who warned us before him, he warned in vain!"

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-05Nietzsche, this article went on, saw how the Jews were becoming "ever more powerful" in Germany and Europe and expressed this in "prophetic words." Above all, the thought that the Jews "were determining what distinguishes"-in other words, that Jews had become important cultural arbiters-filled him with fright. For he knew that this would lead to a transvaluation of values, favoring "the development of the Jewish race, Jewish culture, and Jewish spiritual life-against German essence, German nature, and German culture." He saw a foreign race operating at the cost of his own German Volk; and to Nietzsche-"the man of action-it was incomprehensible that the whole German Volk wasn't arming itself with every weapon in order to save that which is most sacred, its volkish essence." Was Nietzsche an anti-Semite? the article asked rhetorically. "He was-he was in the most intrinsic, pure and sacred sense of the word!"

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-05National Socialist invocations of historical figures were intended as symbolic indications of what the New Germany would become. As Michaud put it, "the awakening into the myth" was "an awakening to the present"-a "recapitulation of the past directed toward the future." Citing Baldur von Schirach was an excellent way for Michaud to support this point. The future Hitler Youth leader stated, "The perfect artists Michelangelo and Rembrandt, and Beethoven and Goethe, do not represent an appeal to return to the past, but show us the future that is ours and to which we belong." The Völkischer Beobachter cultural section was dearly designed for the same reasons.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-05According to its longtime editor-in-chief, Alfred Rosenberg, the "German spirit" that inspired Nietzsche and about which he spoke with great hope had reawakened after the "darkness of the betrayal in 1918" in "the spirit of the Nazi Party." Therein, Rosenberg wrote (in his cryptic style), "a new idea of life" and a worldview that recognized the laws of this life came reverentially into light. In their own time, Rosenberg continued, "National Socialists were experiendng the effects of the forces that became a dangerous, destructive power in the nineteenth century and continued to threaten Europe as a "great outbreak of the most dreadful illness." Nietzsche "stands with us" and Nazis "greet him as a close relative in the formulation of a broadminded worldview, as a brother in the battle for the rebirth of a great German spirituality; as a herald of a European unity, and as a promoter of creative life in our ancient, yet-through a great revolution-rejuvenating continent."

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-05Similarly, Alfred Bäumler, who had been appointed Professor of Philosophy at the University of Berlin largely on the basis of his Nazified Nietzsche interpretations, wrote in the Völkischer Beobachter that the Volk which produced Nietzsche "was the only one that saw the greatest of all dangers threatening mankind." Nazis alone-in contrast to their enemies, who were "reviling the great thinker"- honored the philosopher who "wrestled a new, pure image of man out of confusion and degradation." Nietzsche, according to the leading Nazi Nietzschean, "foresaw and loved the idea we are protecting-that of the man whose innermost seed is bravery, the mother of all virtues; the man who believes: 'That which does not kill us, makes us stronger.'"

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-05Michaud made it clear that Nazi obsession with the cultural historical past was not a retrogressive "move," but a forward-looking call for action. The appropriation of the German tradition of Kultur was "quite the reverse of the work of mourning." It was a "process of reminiscence that asserted itself as faith in one's own power to reawaken the lost object"-that is, to "produce the New Man." The Völkischer Beobachter's identification of Nietzsche as having "foreseen and loved" the New Man of Nazism was utterly consistent with this theme-in fact, a culmination of National Socialist self-validation.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-05Ultimately, production of these Nazi "ideals" involved going to war. Given the horrible outcomes of Nazi military policy, it is natural to assume that the Second World War itself was the primary goal of the regime. But war itself was not the aim. It was a means to an end. And that end was the realization of the new German man in a renewed nation, modeled on an image of Germany as Kulturnationpostulated and popularized, in part, by Völkischer Beobachter cultural coverage.

As one contributor put it: "In the name of all conscientious front soldiers," every "shirker" should read the words of Nietzsche carefully.

Elsewhere, the Völkischer Beobachter stipulated that Nietzsche constantly repeated that "struggle rules throughout nature-that life itself is an outcome of war." Nietzsche, in this view, "valued battle as the basis for all life-so much that he cried, 'Good old war sanctifies everything!'"

In this way, the paper smoothed out another difficulty that Nietzsche's ideas held for Nazi ideology: Individuals could demonstrate their will to power not by becoming creative leaders alone, but alternatively by "accepting the necessity of things," becoming a "part and tool of great world events," and even making the ultímate sacrifice-the "highest self-denial"-for one's Volk. In the years that Germany was gearing up for war, this reading of Nietzsche's concept of will to power was most appropriate for Nazism's militaristic plans.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-05The Völkischer Beobachter was ultimately designed to motivate action in this war, and regularly called on Nietzsche as a major source of inspiration in the struggle once it started. "What makes Nietzsche so valuable today," it proclaimed, is his "fearless acknowledgement of the strong personality that alone can lead toward redemption, and after which all the suffering millions yearn." Not only in Germany, but throughout Europe, "we address him as the preacher of action!" To "treat oneself harshly and tyrannically for the sake of the future of our Volk, that was one of the most important National Socialist requirements. "How often do we recite, in small gatherings, the words of [Nietzsche's] Zarathustra: 'And if ye will not be fates and inexorable ones, how can ye one day-conquer with me? ... For the creators are tough.'" Toughness, "for the sake of our Volk!"-that was what the Völkischer Beobachter felt readers should derive from Nietzsche in wartime.

The National Socialist movement, according to Rosenberg, "stood as a unified whole against the rest of the world, just as Nietzsche stood as an individual against the violent forces of his time." The world of "despicable financiers and their henchmen, the passion whipped up by millions of envious Bolsheviks, the destructive work driven by the rage of the Jewish underworld, this all appeared shortly before the enormous purifying wave [i.e., Nazism] from the heart of Europe began to flow." Now, as Nietzsche had done alone, the "National Socialist panGerman Empire stood as a block of will" in the middle of this tremendous struggle, "serving in full consciousness the necessity of a great life"-the necessity of, in Nietzsche's phrase, a "European destiny."AUTHOR_AFFILIATIONDavid B.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/105/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-06Sarah sets her alarm to go off 30 minutes early. She wants to study for a math test. But she hits the snooze button four times before getting out of bed. She tells herself she'll study during lunch. She spends time looking for her missing gym clothes, so she's late for school. In English class she finds out that a report was due that she didn't even know about. After school, her mom takes her and her little sister shopping for shoes. There go two more hours! After dinner she talks to her best friend for an hour about what a terrible day it's been. Sarah decides to start her homework at 10 p.m. Too bad her math book is still at school. At 11 p.m. she gives up and turns on the TV to watch a rerun. She wails, "I didn't get anything done today." Tomorrow, she promises herself, will be different. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/105/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-06As Sarah found out, the level of productivity you can achieve is directly related to the choices you make about how to use your time. Time management isn't about squeezing more activities into an already overflowing schedule. Time management is about getting the most important things done in a less stressful way. Put these eight P's to work for you, and watch your productivity soar.

Furthermore, they looked at them frequently to remind themselves why.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/105/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-06Get a grip on where your time goes. You can't hope to use your time better unless you know for sure how you use it now. Most time-management experts recommend keeping a 24/7 (24 hours a day, 7 days a week) time log for a few weeks. Accountants and lawyers, for example, bill clients based on time; so if you're interested in either of those professions, think of it as practice.

Buy one at any office supply store, download one from the Web, or make your own.

For example, it's Thursday, and your math teacher has just announced a test next week. You get out your calendar and write TEST in big letters.

Think about what you'll have to do to get ready for that test and when you'll need to do it. Put those items on the calendar too, scheduling more time than you think you'll need. Then fol low through with your plan.

The simplest way to choose what gets done first is to set priorities. If everything on the list seems important, Greissnian suggests asking yourself some questions that will reveal your true priorities:

If something new comes up that you absolutely have to deal with right away, shift to that new priority, but be sure to reschedule the one that was on your list. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/105/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-06Items on your list should have time estimates so you can take advantage of what time-management expert Dave Allen calls "weird time," those little bits of time when you're waiting for someone or you're in between activities.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/105/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-06According to Dr. Robert Arnot, author of The Biology of Success, "Rituals are the foundation of success." He advocates turning every part of your life--sleep, meals, exercise, when and how you work-into a ritual. His point is that anything you can make into a habit or do as a routine frees your brain from worrying. Worrying uses up energy better spent on the work you need to get done.

The key is to get started: Pick the smallest step, the easiest piece, or the part that appeals to you. If worst comes to worst, set a timer for 20 minutes and get to work. Just start!

Chronobiologists (scientists who study biological rhythms) have identified 11 am.-1 p.m. and 4 p.m.-6 p.m. as times of peak energy for most people, but you need to discover your own biorhythms. Do the easy stuff when you're tired, says Arnot, and "don't waste high-energy time on low-energy jobs." If you must work past your peak time, say Eisenberg and Kelly, take a refresher break-- go for a walk, stretch, phone someone who cheers you up.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-06Reducing bullying among students has become a major goal of schools in the modern world, yet little progress is being made and bullying is said to be a growing problem. Several metanalyses of the research on school anti-bullying programs have shown that these programs have little benefit and often make the problem worse. The purpose of this article is to explain the reason for the unimpressive results of our anti-bullying efforts: we have been taking a legal/law enforcement approach to the problem rather than a scientific/psychological approach.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-06April 20, 2013 marked the 14th anniversary of the Columbine shooting, the event that woke our nation to the problem of bullying. Since then, almost all of our 50 states have passed school anti-bullying laws, holding schools responsible for getting rid of bullying. The US Dept. of Education has declared that school funding will be cut for schools that don't address every complaint of bullying. This development has been a great boon for the government bureaucracy, for purveyors of anti-bullying programs, as well as for school mental health professionals, whose positions are often the first to be cut when school funds are limited. In order to comply with the laws, schools need these services more than ever.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-06School administrators have been as eager as the rest of the population to have anti-bullying laws enacted. However, these laws have put schools in a bind. How can they comply with the requirement to eliminate bullying when the research has been showing consistently that the most highly regarded anti-bullying programs are not particularly effective? In the Dec. 2004 issue of the School Psychology Review, a team of researchers led by Canadian School Psychologist David Smith published a study on whole-school anti-bullying programs (Smith, J., Schneider, B, Smith, P., Ananiadou, K., 2004). They had conducted a metanalysis of the published research on whole-school antibullying programs to see how they were working. They discovered that 86 percent of the published studies showed that the anti-bully programs had no benefit or made the problem even worse. Only 14 percent of the published studies showed that the program produced a minor reduction in bullying. Not one program produced a major reduction. Subsequent metanalyses by Vreeman and Carroll (2007), Merrell and Isava (2008), and Ttofi, Farrington and Baldry (2008) have had similar lackluster findings. Oddly, when these researchers find that the most intensive programs resulted in a reduction of 20-23 percent, they consider it a great success. The bar for success in bullying prevention is apparently very low.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-06The most highly revered and widely used bullying prevention program is the Olweus Bullying Prevention Program (OBPP), often referred to as "the gold standard." This is a highly time-and-energy-intensive program that requires everyone in the school community to be involved in combating bullying. The most massive study ever conducted on the OBPP (or any bullying prevention program) was completed in December, 2011, at a cost of $19 million dollars and paid for by the Highmark Foundation in Pennsylvania. After two years of rigorous implementation, the results were a mere 12 percent reduction in the number of students who said they were bullied twice or more per month (Schroeder, et.al, 2012). The study did not even report on children who are bullied daily, the population that should be the focus of concern, for these are the kids who are truly suffering. Assuming, though, a 12 percent across-the-board reduction in the number of children who are bullied, what do we tell the parents of the 88 percent of children who were not helped by the world's most highly revered program?

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-06Some researchers have hailed as successful programs that resulted in an increase in bullying because there was a somewhat higher increase in bullying in the control schools. One such study was of Positive Behaviors and Interventions (PBIS), conducted by Johns Hopkins University, at the expense of $13 million (Grens, K. 2012).

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-06Furthermore, it seems that researchers do not consider the negative consequences of these programs, as though they can't possibly have any. Such negative consequences may include: the promotion of victim mentality; the harm done to children labeled "bullies"; the intensification of hostilities that occur between students and between their families when schools play judge; the anger of parents when schools fail in their promise to protect their children from bullying; the financial cost of the programs; the diversion of staff time from academics to dealing with bullying; and the financial and emotional tolls of the growing number of lawsuits by parents against schools. These, apparently, are not matters the researchers feel that we need to be concerned about. Nor do the researchers concern themselves with the erosion of essential democratic principles, such as freedoms of speech and of assembly caused by anti-bullying programs, policies, and laws.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-06In contrast to the enthusiasm many researchers have for anti-bullying programs and policies is the reality in the field. Tragic bullying-related suicides and shootings continue to occur among children who have been subject to anti-bullying education their entire school history. Whenever states discover that their anti-bullying laws aren't working, officials insist that they need tougher laws and more resources, as though doing that which hasn't been working more intensively is going to make it work. Lawsuits against schools, made possible by these laws, are proliferating, at great expense to the taxpayer. New Jersey, which has proudly passed what it considers to be the toughest school anti-bullying law in the country, is discovering that its schools don't have the funds to comply with the law (Hu, W. 2011), and that bullying complaints quadrupled in the 2011-2012 school year over the previous year (Calefati, J. and Rundquist, J., 2012). Not only are schools being sued for failing to stop children from being bullied, they are also being sued for accusing children of bullying (Rundquist, 2013). New York State passed an anti-bullying law called "The Dignity for All Act." This euphemistically titled law cannot guarantee that all students will be treated with dignity. It is, in reality, a total repeal of freedom of speech. It forbids anyone to say anything to anyone that could offend them for any possible reason. Now, New York is discovering that to avoid being investigated for failing to reduce bullying, many schools are neglecting to report incidents of bullying (Waldman, S. 2013).

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-06Furthermore, while we occasionally read articles about the success of some schools or programs in reducing bullying, no one seems to be eager to report to the public when anti-bullying initiatives are failing. Through my website and seminars on bullying, I hear from many school mental health professionals and educators throughout the country who inform me that their schools' anti-bullying programs seem to be causing an increase in bullying and are making their jobs very unpleasant.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-06The lack of criticism of antibullyism (my label for the anti-bullying movement) in the professional literature despite its obvious failures is glaring. It has been hard to find material written by other psychological professionals that questions the wisdom of antibullyism. The first published book to question antibullyism appeared only in 2009. Developmental psychologist Helene Guldberg wrote a book called, Reclaiming Childhood: Freedom and Play in an Age of Fear, that had one chapter titled "The Bully Bandwagon" that explained some of the problems with the campaign to make schools safe from bullying. Finally, in 2013, an entire book appeared dedicated to the problems caused by antibullyism, psychologist Susan Eva Porter's Bully Nation: Why America's Approach to Childhood Aggression is Bad for Everyone. The apt subtitle reflects the harm caused by this movement to students, schools, parents, taxpayers, and future society.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-06Perhaps even more glaring is the lack of questioning of the morality of antibullyism by ethical leaders. The morality of a movement that is failing and apparently leading to unintended negative consequences deserves to be questioned. Yet antibullyism is supported virtually unanimously by both secular and religious organizations throughout the world, as a salvific scenario to eliminate evil from society. Antibullyism is getting this support despite the fact it is a flagrant violation of the Golden Rule, the universally recognized principal of morality (Kaiman, 2010), and its failure to improve the interpersonal social skills of either "bullies" or "victims" (Porter, 2013). We are freely calling people bullies though few of us would want to be labeled with this demonizing term. Perhaps even worse, we are fighting for laws that hold schools responsible for actions we would never want to be held responsible for. Would any rational parent fight for laws enabling themselves to be sued for failing to get their own two children to always be nice to each other at home? Yet these same parents and the courts see nothing wrong with suing schools for failing to make hundreds of children always be nice to each other-not only during school hours but round the clock.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-06Why are our anti-bully efforts having such unimpressive results? Is there hope of finding approaches that can reliably reduce bullying in schools? A clue to the answers can be found in a message from the President of the National Association of School Psychologists (NASP), Ralph Cash, regarding response to intervention (RTI) and the future of school psychology, "...the real future of school psychology lies in maintaining the emphasis on being psychologists" (Nash, 2009).

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-06This same statement could be made regarding bullying. If we want to succeed in tackling the problem of bullying, psychologists need to be psychologists.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-06HOW COLUMBINE CHANGED THE NATURE OF THE PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFESSION

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-06The Columbine massacre on April 20, 1999 was the most horrific event in modern school history, since the 1927 bombing in Bath, Michigan. The most terrible and obvious harm inflicted at Columbine was the death of fifteen people in the school, including the shooters, and the injury of many more. But it has also harmed schools in a way that has been largely unrecognized.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-06Columbine was the education world's 9/11. September 11,2001 made our nation painfully aware of our vulnerability to terrorist attack. When it feels vulnerable, our government spares little in money and manpower on security. It has spent trillions of dollars and thousands of lives, created Homeland Security, and enacted many laws and regulations, in the effort to make us safe from terrorism. It is arguable whether these efforts have made us any less of a target.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-06Similarly, April 20,1999 heightened our awareness of schools' vulnerability to random shootings by students. Because the Columbine shooting, and most of the school shootings that preceded it, were committed by students who portrayed themselves as victims of bullying by their peers, we also became aware of the suffering of the victims of bullying in general. Though few of such victims ever commit criminal acts of violence, there are children being bullied in virtually every classroom in every school. These millions of children, too, deserve to be spared the misery of being bullied. Thus governments are being pressured to use their power to eliminate bullying.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-06While it is difficult to convince governments to invest large amounts of money on programs that improve mental health and interpersonal skills, it is much easier to obtain massive funding for school safety in the hope of preventing future school shootings and suicides. All parents want their children to be free from being bullied in school. In response to Columbine, our government has made protecting children from both physical and emotional harm a top priority, and the resulting influx of money for school safety has breathed new purpose and funding into school mental health professions.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-06In support of the mandate to make schools safe, our leading psychological organizations declare that children have a right to go to school without being bullied, and advocate for the passage of anti-bullying laws. However, these laws turn nearly all normal childhood meanness into a crime, and hold schools legally responsible for the bullying that occurs among students. We have obligated ourselves to protect students from bullies by intensifying our vigilance in school hallways, bathrooms, and playgrounds, and by instructing students to inform on their peers so that we can investigate, judge and punish ("administer consequences" to) bullies.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-06Because Columbine made school safety our top priority, school psychology has been transformed from being primarily a discipline of the science of human behavior and mental health into a discipline of law enforcement. In fact, there is little difference between the anti-bully lessons taught in school by police officers and those taught by school-based psychology practitioners.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-06Have mental health professionals studied psychology in order to become a security guard, detective, judge or disciplinarian? Most find these roles unappealing. furthermore, it is a waste 01 their talents. A security guard tends to be cheaper and far more intimidating than a mental health professional.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-06There are two general approaches to solving social problems. One of them is the legal approach. The other is the scientific approach. There is a profound difference between the two.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-06THE LEGAL APPROACH

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-06In the legal approach, certain behaviors are declared to be crimes. The population is forbidden from engaging in these behaviors or they will be punished. Law enforcement officers are employed to protect people from the illegal behaviors, and victims are asked to report incidents to the authorities, who then apprehend, interrogate, judge, punish and/or rehabilitate perpetrators. Victims are deemed to be innocent and perpetrators guilty.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-06The act of determining what should be a crime, whether for children or adults, is not generally based on scientific research but on the decision of legislators, often succumbing to the lobbying efforts of special interest groups. Once a law is passed, it must be obeyed even if it causes more harm than good.

The result has been a Court ever mindful of the need for uncomplicated rules that do not hang on a thousand factors and are not dependent on a case-by-case analysis. The rules the Court has developed are simple and straightforward.

They do not need a warrant, but within 48 hours after an arrest made without an arrest warrant, they must bring the person who has been arrested before a judge. The police may conduct an inventory search of any luggage or bags the arrested person has with him or her, but this procedure must be performed consistently. In other words, everything must be subject to the same inventory search. An inventory search cannot be used with some people and not with other people.

Rather, it is an abuse of power by one person over another. It is also different from the normal conflicts of childhood. While all acts of bullying are aggressive, not all aggressive acts are bullying.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/111/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-07 Cracking wise about Narendra Modi is risky, not just because of the Hindu nationalist leader's tough, no-nonsense reputation -- and his followers' sometimes ferocious devotion -- but also because of his sky-high popularity. Still, the country's nascent stand-up comedy scene continues to test the limits of what is fair game. "Raise your hands if you voted for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and if you are not embarrassed," Grover, 34, instructed the audience. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/111/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-07 A few giggled. But many raised their hands. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/111/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-07 Then a volley of Modi jokes followed.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/111/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-07 The audience whistled and guffawed at each joke. Some shouted approvingly, "Killing it, dude!" 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/111/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-07 India has a long tradition of satire in poetry, mimicry and comic movies. But as its movie industry wanes and middle-class affluence expands -- along with Indians' self-confidence and willingness to laugh at themselves -- this kind of U.S.-style stand-up routine is emerging as the cool new thing among young people in the big cities. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/111/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-07 It is almost as much a fad as having a "pasta counter at Punjabi weddings," Grover quipped.

Now, more than a dozen cities host stand-up festivals, and several comedians who have launched comedy start-ups find themselves overwhelmed with applications. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/111/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-07 The comics make fun of everything Indian -- public spitting, honor killing, observing Earth Hour even when there is no electricity to conserve, dating, parental pressures, the traffic, the caste system, Bollywood, Hindu gods, the IT boom, non-English speakers, overpopulation and even Mukesh Ambani, India's richest business baron. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/111/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-07 But as business booms and word of the cozy club network gets out, comics worry about attracting public or government censure.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/111/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-07 "In this landscape of offense-taking, stand-up comedy is an oasis right now. They are saying what they want to in a fairly cutting- edge way, mostly because it has remained in small circuits until now," said Jaideep Verma, who made a documentary film about the industry titled "I Am Offended." "But that may not last long."

"A few comedians often crack horribly bigoted jokes and insult members of lower-caste groups because they know they can get away with it." 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/111/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-07 Many used to crack anti-women and rape jokes, too. But that changed after the fatal gang rape of a young woman in New Delhi in 2012, which stirred profound anger across India. Now, rape jokes are off-limits, and if one is tried, the audience doesn't laugh.

"But we are undergoing a revolutionary awakening now in India. We have just discovered that women are human beings, too." 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/111/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-07 The biggest success story in Indian stand-up belongs to Kapil Sharma, 33, the host of a mega-hit weekly TV show, in Hindi, on the Colors channel. Bollywood and cricket stars line up to appear on the show. Women send him marriage proposals. Men turn up at his door with gifts. Children wear T-shirts inscribed with his catchphrases. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/111/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-07 But television has defanged Sharma's humor, some say. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/111/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-07 "My shows are watched by little children and grandmothers. They have faith that I will not say anything offensive," Sharma said. "We have so many religions, language and caste groups in India that we grow up with a self-censorship device inside us." 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/111/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-07 But outside television, there is a lot of questioning of the emerging India -- including class, privilege and the effects of modernity -- among comedians who perform in Hindi or regional languages. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/111/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-07 "I take my anger to the stage. I am angry because the last two decades of economic growth has only widened the social gap. Our inherent patriarchy is now compounded by this runaway capitalism," said Rajoura, 42, a New Delhi-based Hindi comic who satirizes class and the rural-urban divide. "The rise of stand-up comedy is good. But earlier humor was used as a language of protest. Today it is entertainment for the privileged middle class." 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/111/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-07 Meanwhile, laughter has proved that it can be good politics. A stand-up comedian from Punjab was elected to Parliament as a member of the new Common Man Party this year, and a critique of Modi that he delivered on the House floor has become a hit on YouTube. In rhyming verse, Bhagwant Mann skewered Modi's campaign promise to bring in the "good days," noting that prices have kept right on rising.

But the same potential problems  confronting domestic certification are exacerbated when food is  imported. Employees of the third-party certifiers rarely travel  overseas to make inspections. Instead, the certifiers contract with  local firms operating in the source countries. Such an extended  bureaucratic chain increases the opportunities for fraud and lax  enforcement, especially when food is imported from places rife with  corruption, such as Ukraine and Kazakhstan.

The shelling has terrorized Lebanese civilians, especially in Christian areas, where as many as 50 shells a minute have landed.

But even by Lebanese standards, it was a remarkable confrontation between Syrian troops, unloading their might and firepower on the Christian population, and a Lebanese general bent on driving the Syrians out in what he calls a war of liberation. Despite the terrible cost, Gen. Michael Aoun's struggle appears to have surprising support among Lebanese, Christian and Moslem alike.

The Syrian army and its Lebanese allies-the Shiite Amal militia, the Druze Progressive Socialist Party, the Baath Party and the National Syrian Social Party-have imposed a blockade against the Christian heartland from the north, the mountains to the southeast and the Green Line separating Christian East Beirut from the Syrian-controlled western part. The Christians have just one outlet to the sea from the port of Jounieh.

Another time, she was driving from east to west when a shell landed ahead of her seconds after she was warned to turn back; a third time a man behind her was killed by a sniper as she walked across a deserted horse race track.

Christians aren't alone in wanting to free themselves of Syrian domination; many Moslems feel the same way. Indeed, the man on the street seems to sympathize with Aoun and his bid to prevent Syrian president Hafez Assad from dominating Lebanon.

Depending on nothing more than his growing popularity and a little moral support and military backing from Syria's archrival, Iraq, Aoun appears to have come face-to-face with the formidable Syrian war machine.

Moslem political groups fighting on Syria's side of the battlefield against their own countrymen have a different ax to grind. Syria has offered them all kinds of assistance to confront the Christian political elite and its resistance to reforms that would give Moslems a bigger stake in Lebanon's sectarian system.

But even by Lebanese standards, it was a remarkable confrontation between Syrian troops, unloading their might and firepower on the Christian population, and a Lebanese general bent on driving the Syrians out in what he calls a war of liberation. Despite the terrible cost, Gen. Michael Aoun's struggle appears to have surprising support among Lebanese, Christian and Moslem alike.

My husband and I woke up the children in a hurry and we stole our way down the stairs to the shelter," says Feyrouz Ammar, a Christian mother of five, who lives in the suburb of Jisr al Basha.

"It was like lightning was flickering outside the windows. All you can do is put your hands over your head. It felt as if our ears were falling off. The children cried, screaming: `What is going on outside? Why is this happening to us?' My neighbor's daughter started vomiting."

The Syrian army and its Lebanese allies-the Shiite Amal militia, the Druze Progressive Socialist Party, the Baath Party and the National Syrian Social Party-have imposed a blockade against the Christian heartland from the north, the mountains to the southeast and the Green Line separating Christian East Beirut from the Syrian-controlled western part. The Christians have just one outlet to the sea from the port of Jounieh.

Christians aren't alone in wanting to free themselves of Syrian domination; many Moslems feel the same way. Indeed, the man on the street seems to sympathize with Aoun and his bid to prevent Syrian president Hafez Assad from dominating Lebanon.

Depending on nothing more than his growing popularity and a little moral support and military backing from Syria's archrival, Iraq, Aoun appears to have come face-to-face with the formidable Syrian war machine.

Results have improved dramatically, and in the United States a national collaborative database reported in 1993 that five years after live donor grafts, 75 percent of the kidneys had not been rejected. This procedure allows thousands of children to lead healthy, normal lives.

Pediatric nephrologists may also act as consultants for older children with critical illnesses, injuries, poisonings, and even trauma. Such cases often involve sophisticated intravenous (IV) fluid therapy. Because of temporary renal failure, some of these cases require dialysis.

Continued advances in effectiveness, success rates, safety, and convenience are certain. The gene that causes familial polycystic kidney disease has been identified. Such discoveries, coupled with advances in genetics, may revolutionize therapy and even prevent some renal diseases through genetic engineering.

Police detectives use the evidence in their investigation, and prosecuting attorneys need it to present the case in court. But other experts analyze and explain each piece of evidence. These specialists are forensic scientists.

Forensic scientists perform comprehensive chemical and physical analyses on evidence submitted by law enforcement agencies. Their work is often instrumental in apprehending and convicting criminals. Although most forensic scientists focus on criminal cases and are sometimes called criminalists, others work in the civil justice systemÂ­for example, performing handwriting comparisons to determine the validity of a signature on a will.

It was a defining event for Marines, sailors and soldiers who survived. It was the first major operation against Americans for Hezbollah and its Iranian backers and would establish the terrorist tactics that paved the path to Sept. 11. The 23 Oct. 1983 bombing of the U.S. military barracks in Beirut, Lebanon, was an unimaginable crime against humanity and a harbinger of the coming GWOT.

No sooner had the truck stopped before it detonated, creating what FBI investigators later would describe as the largest non-nuclear blast that they ever had studied. Three soldiers, 18 sailors and 220 Marines died, and dozens more were trapped in the debris, many severely injured. Some of those died months or years after the bombing. Most of those who survived still carry the mental and/or physical scars today.

They first went ashore in early 1982 to oversee evacuation of about 15,000 armed combatants of Yassar Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization. Shortly after that, they went back in at the request of the Lebanese government as part of a multinational peacekeeping force after the Lebanese president was assassinated. Thousands of Marines, sailors and soldiers would rotate in and out of Lebanon for that mission between 1982 and 1984. During that time, 270 would die; hundreds would be injured. All this was in the name of peace.

The answers are rooted in history thousands of years old, dating back to prebiblical times. This history has formed a myriad of political, religious and ethnic beliefs and relationships of the dozens of varying governments, militaries, militias, sects and fringe groups involved in the Middle East. All these players have their own set of values and try to impose them on others who don't necessarily want them.

Marines, sailors and soldiers knew only that they were placed in the midst of this turmoil with a mission that was relatively new to the U.S. military: peacekeeping. The irony of that title can be appreciated only if one considers that in that part of the world peace has been elusive for thousands of years. Peace in the Middle East continues to be a paper tiger chasing its own tail.

Iran framed Hezbollah's primary objective: to engage in terrorist activities in order to convert Lebanon into an Islamic theocracy modeled after Iran.

Detonating cord is a plastic and fiber cord that has the PETN in white powder form extruded into the cord.

This meant that the material had to come directly from a manufacturer.

The presence of unconsumed PETN at the Marine barracks explosion led to the finding that the PETN used in this case had not been the standard commercial form.

Court records state that in 1983 PETN was not manufactured in Lebanon, but was in Iran.

For all his success, he has managed to collect only about 1 percent of the damages for his clients or himself, for that matter, as he takes most of the cases on a contingency basis. He recently told Newsweek that existing laws make it difficult to trace and seize frozen foreign assets in the United States.

However, a 1996 bill passed by Congress allowed civil suits against countries deemed state sponsors of terrorism.

A Web-exclusive Newsweek article by Dan Ephron pointed out that this is a significant shift according to analysts and legal scholars.

The legislation has a long history and plenty of opponents. State Department officials say it will deny them a key bargaining chip in dealings with so-called rogue states, while the business community fears it will expose U.S. investors in the Middle East to reciprocal measures.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-11By the mid-1840s, the U.S. was plagued by multiple divisive controversies that went beyond the chronic dispute over the institution of slavery, although slavery was interwoven into some of these other disputes. These included arguments over the annexation of Texas, further territorial expansion, and rising violence against Catholics and Mormons. Bicknell tries to coalesce these and other issues into a single, decisive year: that in which Henry Clay contested James Polk for the presidency. This is a fast-moving, easily digestible account of that year, and Bicknell does a fine job of explaining the issues, the personalities, and the shifting political trends that made the period tumultuous. Bicknell offers interesting vignettes with insights into the principal players, including Polk, Clay (a surprisingly weak candidate), the doomed prophet Joseph Smith, and the preacher William Miller, who urged thousands of followers to await the imminent return of Christ. Many historians will justifiably reject this effort to label this particular year as a historical game changer, but Bicknell does provide a useful portrait of the antebellum nation that is aimed at general readers. -Jay Freeman

But the U.N. refused. Dallaire continued to try to stop the attacks on Tutsis, but his efforts weren't enough. Eventually, Paul Kagame and the Rwandese Patriotic Front fought the Hum militias for three months and took power of Rwanda in July of 1994. They ended the genocide, but with almost no help from the international community.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/102/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-12July 31--WASHINGTON -- Sen. Marco Rubio said he supports the legalization of some strains of marijuana, such as one recently approved by Florida's Legislature, for legitimate pain management. But he does not support the state ballot initiative, which he called a "ruse" to allow people to access the drug to get high. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/102/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-12 "If there is a medical condition that can be treated or alleviated through the use of medicinal marijuana, that's something that I'd be open to," Rubio, R-Fla., said Wednesday. Last month, Gov. Rick Scott signed into law a bill that permits Floridians to use a "non-euphoric" strain of marijuana to treat conditions such as severe epilepsy, Lou Gehrig's disease and to alleviate pain from cancer.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/102/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-12 Medical marijuana laws have been abused in other states, he said. Rubio said he would support the use of strains "that don't have elements that are mind-altering or create the high." 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/102/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-12 Rubio further clarified his support for medicinal marijuana only "without creating the specter of widespread recreational use." 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/102/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-12 Most people would be supportive of that, he said.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/105/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-12The OU football season is officially a third of the way through, and the Sooners have managed to make it through their first four games with a perfect record. The schedule will only get tougher as they advance into conference play, and the Sooners will have to keep improving if they want to keep winning. Here's how we grade OU's performance on both sides of the ball so far this season. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/105/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-12 Quarterback: B Sophomore Trevor Knight has shown flashes of his dominant Sugar Bowl performance, but at times he has looked like the quarterback that had fans calling for Blake Bell to start a few games into last season. Overall Knight has been a new and improved version of what we saw last year, showing why he won the job as a true freshman. The lack of depth behind Knight has limited the team's willingness to let him make plays with his legs, but he has shown an improved ability to get out of bounds or slide to avoid the hit when allowed to run the ball. The success of the ground game has allowed Knight to settle into a role as a facilitator and he has done a good job of making plays when he needs to.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-12TRISTAN REYES: I was born here. According to what our ancestors and some historians like the Venezuelan Maria Elena Vasquez-who studied African roots a great deal, how things were here, and who wrote a book-the majority of blacks brought to Peru were blacks from the Congo, Angola, Mozambique, and South Africa. Their language was Quibundo. Their religion was witchcraft, as is still the case today in many parts of the world. Because they had sex aboard the ships in which they were being transported, they formed ten casts of blacks. Among the ten casts of blacks were the Terranovas, the Locumies, the Mandingas, the Cahundas, the Calveies, the Cangaes, the Chalas, the Guadacholies, and the Congo. The split was based on the original four casts there had been. For instance, that's why my skin is a bit darker; my cousin Augusto has lighter skin. This is what they called casts. They also took into account height, build, weight, skin color, facial features. There are blacks who have very thick lips; there are blacks who have a broad nose; there are blacks who have straighter profiles. There has been a type of black whose bottom half of their bodies is longer and who are shorter from the waist up. And when blacks and Indians started mixing, the zambo resulted. The mulatto resulted. More variants started to emerge, until we got to the present day.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-12San Jose was a hacienda of blacks. There was the transition from slavery to semi-slavery, and then to liberty while what really changed were the owners of the hacienda. It started with Monte Blanco, or "Carrillo" as they called them. From them, it got passed on to the Benavides. The Benavides kept it within the family until the Siones came forward and took over everything. We're talking about more than 12,455 acres. A single brother was in charge, and they liked to work with blacks a lot. We're talking about the 1700s, 1600s, or 1800s. There was plenty of water here. Sugar cane was planted. Blacks harvested the sugar cane. They went out singing early in the morning. For instance, they sang: "I was born on the beaches of Magdalena, under the shades of a valley beyond. Because my mother was a black slave, I, too, carried the mark." Or maybe they sang, "Oh, cursed luck, to carry chains and be a slave and be the slave of an evil master. If I could pick up my spear, I would steal his life and set fire to his sugar cane and tear out his heart." They harvested the cane with love, because they had no other choice. They lamented because they wanted to forge ahead. The work was all done by blacks and some native-born people. The one who was in charge stood still; he didn't do anything. For him, it was easy. He's not bent over for more than forty-five hours. He's on a horse. But the black man started changing little by little. They say that time heals all wounds. The black man began to learn. The men in charge found black women beautiful, and akundun.

Gonzales came here and heard one of his aunts, who has since died. He greeted her and said, "How are you, little momma?" "Getting by, Miki," she said. "It's been some time since I made akundun." "And what is that, exactly?" "It's an African word." "What does it mean?" "Hey, you want people to give you everything for free," she said. She said, "Miki, I have been a widow for twenty years. It's been a while since I've made love. So akundun means to make love." Let's suppose that they each lived there, with everything open. Everything. So your children wouldn't know, you would tell your woman, "Woman, akundun." She would take the children and tell them it was time to go to bed. They would turn off the lights, cover themselves, and akundun. On the basis of this, the transformation took place, and the hacienda owners stayed with the blacks.

The sugar cane needed water, and there was none. The hacienda owners brought in cotton. Blacks were accustomed to the sugar cane, to harvesting it. If they were walking along, they would cut down a cane and eat from it. Cotton, which is a hank, has shells that harden when opened. You're picking the cotton and it scratches you. Cotton was more difficult because you had to approach it from top to bottom. The black man found the work more difficult. And the black man was used to stopping at a certain time to eat breakfast. He ate heartedly with his company. He took an hour to rest. So they brought groups of people from the mountains, and they would put them to work. They would make them sleep there, and times had changed. The serrano would come, he would dip a ball of coca, and he would pick cotton from five in the morning until four in the afternoon. He kept himself going with the coca. He was more effective at picking cotton than the black man. While the serrano picked 250 kgs. of cotton, the black man picked 150 kgs., because he lost two hours eating. The serrano kept going. The serrano also found the hacienda more beautiful than the mountains. For instance, there were different kinds of flowers. The serrano had never seen this type of thing. If 300 came, thirty would stay. They wouldn't leave, and little by little they got used to the area. There are serranos who stayed.

It's comprised of six parts. It is sixty centimeters high and forty centimeters wide. On the other side of where you play it, it has a hole. It's made of a wood called plywood. It has reinforcements at the corners so it won't come apart. Its origins come from Africa, because there they had a tree trunk they played. And just as we have the telephone, they used this to communicate. Because they didn't have a trunk here, they made the cajon. Anyway, the cajon then became a way to communicate. At a particular time at night, the slave owners made everybody go home so the next day they could handle a lot of work. But if I wanted to communicate with the neighbor, how would I do it? So they started with a single hit, three hits, four hits, five hits, whatever, until little by little they realized they could produce music with the cajon.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-12I'll share an anecdote with you. Here, there were two cajon players. One of them was Neftali Coronado. He was one of the best in the region. And the other one was Roberto Rogarton. They called him Roberto Chupi. Neftali Coronado had a sister whose name was Morali Coronado Fernandez. Their grandmother had passed away. And at that time, you stayed in mourning for two and a half years. There was no music in the house, there was no dancing, there were no parties. People wore black, in mourning. So after a mass to mark two years since the grandmother's death, they were eating. A glass fell to the floor and it broke. Neftali Coronado does this [hits cajon], as if to say, "What luck!" on the table. And Roberto plays, too. And Neftali Coronado was going to respond when his sister comes out of the kitchen with a ladle and a stick and says, "Agh, enough. We've just finished mass for someone who's passed away, so you're out." She kicked her brother out of the house, for the single sound he made, and because the other fellow thought he was calling him.

In reality, what was the point of being free if at 6:00 p.m. they played the bell that signaled you were to go home and go to sleep? As I said before, it was so you could handle a lot of work the next day. My uncle Felix Mendoza Zegarra got married to Fermina BatÃ³n during the daytime. Six o' clock came. The group of men charged with enforcing the curfew had been at the wedding- the leader, Anectari Joya, my great-grandfather Juan Tristan, and a Mr. Espinoza. The wedding party asked the enforcers not to ring the bell because the best was yet to come. But like good enforcers, they had to carry out the boss's orders. They rang the bell. The celebrants closed the door and they continued at the table. In those days, the bride embroidered the tablecloth, working until the day that had been given for the ceremony. The thing is that on the wedding day, the bride had to have the tablecloth finished. So the table was served, and the curfew enforcers came and broke down the door. They came with the boss. The boss was carrying his revolvers and gun powder. They came and pulled the table cloth down to the floor with everything on it. And they took the groom to a room exactly nine feet by twelve feet made out of something similar to cement. This room had a door of iron through which air only got in through 108 holes. They put the groom in those stocks. Inside, the stocks had a tube at a height of about fifteen inches with little arches at the ends and in the middle. Under that, there was a sliding piece of metal full of rings. So they would place the black man in a position of virtually forty-five degrees, with his feet raised and inserted into the rings. They didn't put the rings on Felix Mendoza, but they did lock him up there. It was to be his happiest night, but he spent it in the stocks.

The curfew enforcers had aged, and they started dying. Others had emigrated. Felix was a hard-working man, but he had a temper. So a time came when the boss asked him to come and told him, "You know what, Felix?" And he opened his desk drawer and pulled out one of those old revolvers that took gun powder and said, "From this moment on, you're going to be an enforcer." And Felix didn't take the revolver by the handle, but by the barrel, and he says, "Sir, you want me to be an enforcer now? Have you already forgotten that the day I got married to my wife who's now passed away you put me in the stocks? On my wedding night. Take your revolver because I'll kill you with it." He was still resentful about being sent to the stocks on his wedding night. It was the biggest humiliation he could have had in his life. He was the last black man to be put in the stocks as a punishment.

I have gone in and have imagined- now, there's just the piece of metal. The sliding part and the rings aren't there anymore. I have imagined seeing a black man in that position, and I swear to you that tears have fallen down my face. And now, the conflict I have is that for fifty years, my mom was the cook of the Siones Benavides. I was born at the hacienda. In fact, one of the brothers and I are the same age. We are one month apart. We were both raised there. I was raised with all of them, and when puberty came and I realized how much people had suffered and I found out about my ancestors, I became rebellious and I didn't spend time with them anymore. The same empathy wasn't there anymore. The camaraderie or empathy that we'd had when we played as children wasn't there. Now there was rebelliousness and resentment about how whites had treated my ancestors.

Currently, three percent of the population here is black. The rest are serranos, a mix of all the races-here in San Jose and everywhere else. They come in stages. There was a time when Miki Gonzales came and there was the union between blacks and Indians. In actuality, it's rate to find a very black person. There are situations that have transformed the communities. For instance here in San Jose, we don't foster black culture in terms of music, in terms of customs. Why? Because the families of many people immigrated to the United States. They started to be more interested in African American or Puerto Rican music, which is practically the root of salsa. Here, things started to get lost, and more effort was devoted to salsa. Here, for instance, there's no zapateo. There's no troupe of blacks. El Carmen does have a troupe of black dancers. It has zapateo dancers. In Guayabo, they know how to do the zapateo. In San Regis, they have a black troupe. In Chamorro, they have a troupe. San Jose doesn't. There's a different tradition. Many very good decimistas came from here.

Each person takes a turn. Gonzalo Joya told his beautiful wife, "You are a jewel who always supports me." I'm the one who has compiled a lot, but the best writer is one of my uncles, Mauro Quiroz. There are people like Augusto Jose Munoz de Tristan who have the talent to have done this type of thing, but they can't publish the work. This isn't published. It's registered, but under the name of my friend Cochicho Ambrosio. The registry was very extensive. Because we're all part of the same group, I gave the work to him and he registered it under his name but with a mark of my name.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-12The inability to distinguish particular color combinations, or "color blindness," is one of the most common and best understood inherited anomalies, having first been self-diagnosed more than 200 years ago by English chemist John Dalton. In the United States, an estimated 10 million men (about 7% of the male population) cannot distinguish the colors green and red, and as many of 8% of men and 1% of women have some degree of color blindness. Thus, the recent report by Mancuso and colleagues,1 which describes the successful correction of such a color deficit in two squirrel monkeys, is of considerable interest.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-12The normal human retina contains two classes of light-sensing neurons: rod photoreceptors, which respond to dim light, and cone photoreceptors, which respond to bright light; the latter were the focus of the study by Mancuso et al. Vision begins with the absorption of light by visual pigments in these cells. In humans, cone photoreceptors carry one of three different pigments (opsins). These pigments are maximally sensitive at different wavelengths (long, middle, and short wavelengths, or red, green, and blue, respectively), and persons who have these three pigments are called trichromats. Combined, the absorption spectra of the three pigments cover the visible spectrum.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-12Different forms of color blindness result from the loss or modification of one or more of the cone opsins. The most common anomaly is loss of one color opsin (usually, pigment that is sensitive to the long or middle wavelength); in such persons, dichromacy results. Superficially, dichromats appear to have normal vision. They can have 20/20 visual acuity, full visual fields, and normal sensitivities to white light. However, they have difficulty with color identification, which can create problems in day-to-day activities -- for example, selecting coordinated colors in clothing and seeing details in slide presentations, color-coded signals, certain graphic images, and stained histologic sections. Indeed, the transportation industry places restrictions on hiring persons with color blindness for certain jobs.2

Ultimately, though, the investigators succeeded in delivering the wild-type human L-opsin gene to a fraction (15 to 36%) of long- and middle-wavelength cone photoreceptors through subretinal injection of a recombinant, replication-defective adeno-associated virus (AAV) (Figure 1).

Mancuso et al.1 recently reported the induction of trichromatic color vision after introducing the missing (third) visual pigment to the cone photoreceptors of dichromatic monkeys. Panel A shows the approach used by the investigators, in which they delivered the wild-type human L-opsin gene to cone photoreceptors through subretinal injection of a recombinant, replication-defective adeno-associated virus (AAV). Panel B shows how dichromatic animals that lack long-wavelength pigment in cone photoreceptors might see a collection of fruits and vegetables before and after gene therapy (upper row), as indicated by immunofluorescence-labeled sections of monkey retina (lower row) (still life courtesy of Elise Maguire; micrograph courtesy of Waixing Tang, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine).

Five months after injection, the monkeys were found to have trichromatic vision, which they have maintained for more than 2 years. Results of behavioral testing correlated with findings on physiological tests (carried out 10 months after injection) in the one monkey who underwent the two tests. The report does not explain why it took 5 months for the monkeys to notice new colors and whether there might have been a learning effect, since AAV-mediated transgene expression is usually detectable within weeks after injection.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-12What are the implications of these results? Could this approach be used for treating color blindness in humans? Given the fact that dichromatic humans can carry out most of the same activities as trichromatic persons and that other aspects of their vision are excellent, the risk-benefit ratio of gene therapy involving subretinal injection for dichromatism does not seem favorable. The fact that color blindness is so prevalent begs the question of whether the condition should be considered a phenotypic variant rather than a disease. An impeccable safety profile of the approach would have to be shown before human application could be considered, especially since the two monkeys that were studied by Mancuso et al. received unspecified postinjection corticosteroid therapy, suggesting that there might have been inflammation. Nevertheless, it is tempting to consider the possibility of "converting" dichromatism into trichromatism. By extension, sensorineural abilities could theoretically be expanded further -- for example, through the creation of tetrachromacy (as found in the European starling), with the capacity for seeing flowers as a honeybee sees them.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-12Of more importance, however, are the implications of this study with respect to the treatment of other diseases involving cone photoreceptors. The results of this study suggest that signals that are initiated through the modified cones are relayed to the visual cortex through intact retinal-central nervous system circuitry and that neural connections that are present from birth are capable of processing an input delivered to a mature animal.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-12The investigators describe their results as running counter to the predictions of Wiesel and Hubel3 with respect to visual deprivation. Wiesel and Hubel found that the prevention of visual input in kittens during a critical period in development altered the ocular dominance in the visual system and that plasticity diminished after this critical period, after which it was not possible to reverse the domains, even if visual input was restored. However, the dichromatism that was treated by Mancuso et al. is not analogous to amblyopia (the clinical correlate of the studies by Wiesel and Hubel). The nature of sensorineural deprivation in the study by Wiesel and Hubel was fundamentally different in that it affected all aspects of photoreceptor stimulation and resulted in profound organic changes that are not described in color deficiency. Nevertheless, Mancuso et al. have found that it is possible to reprogram old neuronal wiring to carry new signals. Assuming that amblyopia does not become a problem in humans, the study by Mancuso et al. bodes well for the possibility of ameliorating other cone diseases, such as complete achromatopsia, cone-rod dystrophy, and some maculopathies. It should be possible not only to restore function and obtain vision from diseased cones in mature eyes but also to save these cells from death.

Interest has increased in the past century and a half ever since Joseph Lupton first published Colet's writings in the 1870s.1 In the first half of the twentieth century, scholars have acknowledged the controversial nature of the history of Colet criticism, stemming from Erasmus's portrait of Colet in his letter to Jodocus Jonas of 1521 as a Catholic, but also a humanist and anti-scholastic, much like Erasmus himself.2 From those beginnings, a vigorous tug-of-war arose between supporters of Catholic or Protestant readings of Colet on key issues of divine grace and human freedom. This form of the controversy can be witnessed in the sixteenth-century biographies by John Foxe, who championed Colet's Protestant leanings, and Thomas Harding, who defended Colet as a pious Catholic.3

This even becomes more worrisome as many Nigerian non-smokers are helplessly exposed to cigarette smoke on a daily basis at home, workplace, shops and more. In this report, VICTOR OKEKE writes on why government should show more seriousness in checking smoking in public places in Nigeria.

If this trend continues unchecked, the predictions of researchers are certainly going to be our lot in this country.

Hearing loss is often viewed as an evitable consequence of old age, but the research shows this may not always be true," said Dr. Piers Dawes.

According to a team of researchers from the University of Ilorin, University of Nigeria and Obafemi Awolowo University in a study conducted in three cities in Nigeria, of the 583 non-smoking respondents in the study, up to 40 percent had a regular exposure to passive smoking mostly in public places.

Among men, the primary cause to exposure at any location were lack of secondary school education, residing in slum apartments (house with many households), living with a smoking family member, lack of smoking restriction laws, and alcohol consumption.

Nigeria conducted the global youth tobacco survey and it clearly showed that 15 percent of our children between the ages 13 and 15 were already smokers, while 55 percent of the children were exposed to passive smoking.

It is necessary that the National Assembly expedite action in passing to law the Tobacco Control Bill which is before it.

These include making their homes smoke-free. Limiting their smoking to one or two rooms is not an effective measure -tobacco smoke can easily drift through the rest of the house.

People are advised to avoid taking children to outdoor areas where people are smoking and also to ensure that all people who look after their children provide a smoke-free environment.

Knowing the devastating effect of cigarette smoking, the government should leave no stone unturned in the effort to curtail it. If people can't be stopped from smoking, they should be halted from endangering the lives of people around them with their habit.

The estimates of prevalence of overweight/obesity (a parts per thousand yen85th percentile) and obesity (a parts per thousand yen95th percentile) were presented for gender, age, ethnicity, and placement type. Multiple logistic regression was used to examine potential associations between demographic and placement variables and weight status. The prevalence of overweight/obesity was almost 40 % and obesity was 23 % for the study population. Children placed in a group home had the highest prevalence of overweight/obesity (60 %) and obesity (43 %) compared to other types of placement. Within this study, older children (ages 12-19) were more likely to be overweight/ obese than normal weight compared to children between 2 and 5 years old when controlling for gender, ethnicity and placement (OR = 2.10, CI = 1.14-3.87). These findings suggest that older age and long- term foster care in general may be risk factors for obesity."

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/101/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-13The growing human and economic toll of diabetes has caused consternation worldwide. Not only is the number of people affected increasing at an alarming rate, but onset of the major forms of the disease occurs at ever younger ages. We now know that the reach of diabetes extends far beyond the classic acute metabolic and chronic vascular complications to increased risk of an ever-increasing array of conditions including Alzheimer disease, cancer, liver failure, bone fractures, depression, and hearing loss. In the U.S. one in three Medicare dollars is spent on care of people with diabetes, and the proportion of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk attributable to diabetes is rising. While complications of diabetes may develop slowly over decades, antecedents of diabetes may lay in utero or early life. Thus the breadth of meaningful research extends across the life span, ranging from studies of how the in utero environment alters diabetes risk to improved understanding of the special needs of older patients with diabetes.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/101/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-13Since the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) was established in 1950, we have seen huge progress in our ability to predict, classify, and treat diabetes and its complications as well as to prevent or delay type 2 diabetes. Landmark NIDDK-led clinical trials have demonstrated that glucose control can dramatically reduce diabetes complications, and lifestyle change producing modest weight loss, or the drug metformin, can substantially reduce development of type 2 diabetes. Were it not for this progress, the toll from rising rates of the major forms of diabetes would be much higher.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/101/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-13Despite a challenging fiscal climate, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) expends over $1 billion on diabetes research annually. NIDDK accounts for about two-thirds of this total, and we are determined that these resources will be invested wisely and balanced among competing priorities. We must address the most compelling practical questions about clinical management and prevention of diabetes and its complications while also uncovering and exploiting novel pathways that will provide new targets and approaches to combat the disorder. Last year, a new strategic plan for diabetes research (1) was issued under NIDDK's leadership with input from over 100 scientists and multiple federal agencies and components of NIH. The plan highlights progress and opportunities in 10 key areas as well as resource and infrastructure needs. Conquering diabetes will require a wide range of expertise and talent from molecular and cell biology to behavioral and social sciences. Development and empowerment of this human capital is critical to this endeavor, including facilitating multidisciplinary collaborations and the application of new technologies to diabetes research. Here we will touch on highlights of our diabetes research priorities and initiatives, referring readers to the Diabetes Research Strategic Plan (1) for a more comprehensive analysis of advances and opportunities.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/101/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-13A well-trained and diverse scientific workforce is essential to our efforts to improve outcomes for people with or at risk for diabetes. To ensure a pipeline of new well-trained investigators in basic and clinical disciplines, NIDDK supports training grant, fellowship, and career award mechanisms to provide opportunities for investigators at all stages of the career trajectory. These are supplemented by programs targeted to specific needs, such as our medical student research program in diabetes, which allows medical students to conduct research under the direction of an established scientist at one of our seventeen NIDDK-funded Diabetes Research Centers; supplements to research and training grants to foster recruitment of underrepresented minority scientists to diabetes research; and institutional career development programs to attract pediatric endocrinologists to careers in childhood diabetes research. It is increasingly important to build multidisciplinary research teams and train multidisciplinary researchers. We are establishing interdisciplinary training grants to promote diabetes research training for bioengineers as well as career development programs in diabetes research for behavioral scientists. We will continue to foster the application of new expertise, for example in computational science and bioinformatics, to diabetes research problems. To help new investigators transition to independence, we also provide a less stringent pay line for early career investigators. We also invite new investigators with NIDDK research or career development grants to participate in NIDDK workshops designed to help them succeed as independent investigators.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/101/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-13To uncover new approaches to prevention and therapy of diabetes and its devastating complications, NIDDK will continue to support a robust portfolio of investigator-initiated basic research. NIDDK has recently developed data on application and funding trends to help our research community understand the application and funding dynamics over recent years. This information is available at http://www2. niddk.nm.gov/FunaUng/Grants/FundingTrendsandValues.htni. It shows that relative funding levels of most research categories have remained fairly stable since 2003, and demonstrates our continuing strong support of investigator-initiated research project grants or ROls and training and career development programs. Information on resources to empower researchers, such diabetes centers, human islets, mouse models, reagents, and databases, and on funding opportunities and staff to contact in specific program areas is available at http://www2.niddk.nih.gov/Research/ ScientificAreas/Diabetes/.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/101/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-13Diabetes prevention is a major public health challenge. For type 2 diabetes, the NIDDK-led Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) demonstrated a dramatic effect of modest weight loss or the generic drug metformin in delaying or preventing type 2 diabetes (2). Ongoing studies are examining the durability of this risk reduction, the cost effectiveness of the interventions, and their impact in reducing diabetes complications. To facilitate translation of landmark clinical research into clinical practice and public health activities, NIDDK established a program to test practical, cost-effective approaches to deliver interventions proven efficacious in clinical trials for effectiveness in community and practice settings. One such NIDDKsupported study of a lifestyle change intervention delivered by YMCA fitness trainers (3) already is being rolled out nationwide by the YMCA with coverage from insurers such as United Health Group. In another promising approach, diabetes educators trained selected patients with well-controlled diabetes to serve as community health workers delivering a lifestyle intervention based on the DPP to community members with prediabetes (4). This NIDDK-funded research provides a basis for a new congressionally established National Diabetes Prevention Program at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to foster delivery of evidence-based lifestyle change programs for people at high risk for type 2 diabetes. Given the sustained effort required to achieve and maintain lifestyle change, much additional research is needed to improve, disseminate, and evaluate type 2 diabetes prevention programs in the U.S. Approaches are also needed to reduce the development of risk factors for diabetes. Of particular importance are studies to reduce environmental exposures during pregnancy or childhood that may increase diabetes and obesity risk.

Bold new programs aimed at preventing type 1 diabetes have been undertaken with support from the Special Statutory Funding Program for Type 1 Diabetes Research, which provides $150 million per year through 2013 for type 1 diabetes research. These special funds are in addition to the regular NIH appropriation. One program established under the program, The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young (TEDDY), has screened nearly half a million neonates to establish a cohort of over 8,000 at high genetic risk for type 1 diabetes. Participants will be followed from birth through 15 years of age to identify dietary, infectious, microbiome, or other environmental triggers of autoimmunity and type 1 diabetes and to study the interaction between environmental factors and specific genetic variations associated with disease risk. Identification of an infectious agent or dietary factor that triggers or protects against the disease would have immense implications for prevention through the development of a vaccine or dietary change. Also with special program support, the Type 1 Diabetes TrialNet is identifying individuals recently diagnosed with type 1 diabetes or at high risk of developing the disease and testing interventions to prevent diabetes or to slow its progression. Selective immune modulation has been shown to preserve insulin secretion in newly diagnosed patients, and TrialNet is exploring the use of one such agent, teplizumab, to prevent type 1 diabetes in individuals at very high short-term risk of type 1 diabetes. In the future, combination therapies aimed at modulating multiple steps of the toxic immune response and restoring immunoregulation may produce a clinically significant delay in onset and ultimately the prevention of type 1 diabetes.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/101/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-13While information on how to prevent and treat type 2 diabetes has grown rapidly, adequate data from rigorous clinical trials are not available to inform many routine decisions on care for patients with diabetes. Current guidelines are moving away from a "one size fits all" approach to incorporate factors such as diabetes duration and the presence of complications or other comorbidities. However, we lack information to individualize therapy based on demographic, physiologic, or genetic variation. Improved understanding of the genetic, physiologic, and environmental factors that underlie diabetes mellitus are necessary for more individualized diabetes treatment.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/101/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-13Numerous drugs are approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, based largely on relatively short-term efficacy in glycÃ©mie reduction. However, it is not known whether particular drugs or drug combinations will have more durable effects in the maintenance of glucose control. NIDDK is supporting a large comparative effectiveness trial to inform the choice of second agent when metformin alone is inadequate for glycÃ©mie control. This multicenter randomized trial will provide information on health benefits as well as cost effectiveness of widely used treatments.

Major questions include the optimal timing of interventions, whether specific treatments have maximum benefit at different stages of the disease, and what patient characteristics influence the choice of initial therapy for individuals. A newly formed consortium will examine the approaches to the initial treatment of type 2 diabetes that may reverse or slow the decline in Ã-cell function over time.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/101/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-13While major trials have established the importance of blood pressure and lipid control in reducing CVD in type 2 diabetes, much less is known about how cardiovascular risk factors should be managed in type 1 diabetes. When blood pressure and lipid lowering should begin and optimal therapeutic targets remain to be established. Although type 1 diabetes increases the risk of CVD as much as 10fold compared to an age-matched population, testing practical approaches to mitigate this risk is challenging due to the low incidence of CVD in the younger type 1 diabetes population. Such trials may require the development of the validated biomarkers discussed below.

The choices patients make daily about diet, physical activity, adherence to medications, self-monitoring, foot and dental care, and medical follow-up for early detection of complications are critical for improving diabetes outcomes. Research has established effective counseling and education strategies, including motivational interviewing, patient empowerment, and social and peer support. However, research is needed to expand the reach of such approaches to more patients and providers. NIDDK encourages research studying approaches such as group visits, telemedicine, and social media that may extend the impact of the limited workforce skilled in the provision of this care.

Intensive glycÃ©mie control in youth may afford lifelong protection from complications yet infancy and adolescence pose unique challenges in attaining such control. Treatment priorities and optimal glycÃ©mie, blood pressure, and cholesterol targets to prevent complications and maintain quality of life may differ for older adults or those with limited life expectancy. The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD)led Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcome (HAPO) study (5) showed that perinatal harm to mother and offspring occurs in pregnancy at lower levels of glycemia than previously appreciated. To identify gestational glycÃ©mie thresholds for longer-term effects on offspring and the risk of type 2 diabetes in mothers, NIDDK will support a follow-up study of this important cohort. NIDDK has also recently launched a study to explore approaches for the prevention of gestational diabetes mellitus. It also remains to be established what treatments during pregnancy mitigate perinatal and/or long-term complications of gestational diabetes mellitus.

The alarming emergence of type 2 diabetes in youth overwhelmingly occurs in minority populations. Ominous data on poor risk factor control portends very poor outcomes for this vulnerable population. To address this threat, NIDDK recently completed a major multicenter trial comparing three approaches to the treatment of type 2 diabetes in youth and a trial conducted in schools serving poor and minority children to prevent the development of risk factors for type 2 diabetes.

Critical questions must be addressed about optimal strategies to prevent and treat diabetes. For example, early diabetes diagnosis and treatment helped improve survival in people with cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD). An NIDDK-funded trial showed that chronic weight loss can be reversed with the institution of insulin therapy but not with repaglinide early in the course of CFRD before fasting hyperglycemia develops (6). A current initiative will support research to understand the pathogenesis of CFRD, which affects half of adults with cystic fibrosis. NIDDK will also encourage research on treatment and prevention of diabetes in HIV patients.

Spanning decades and generations, longitudinal studies of Pima Indians have uncovered physiologic, environmental, and genetic determinants of diabetes in the U.S. population with highest rates of type 2 diabetes. These studies have foreshadowed findings in the broader population, such as the contribution of intrauterine factors to childhood obesity and type 2 diabetes and the prognosis for these youth. Collaborations between intramural and extramural researchers studying individuals with severe insulin resistance and lipodystrophy have yielded important physiologic information and the emergence of leptin replacement therapy for lipodystrophy.

NIDDK has partnered with CDC to support the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth study. This multicenter study identifies cases of diabetes in people below 20 years of age in five geographically dispersed populations that encompass the ethnic diversity of the U.S.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/101/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-13So that information on diabetes can be obtained at lower cost than if an independent study were initiated, NIDDK provides substantial support for the diabetes components of major CDC-led efforts including the National Health and Nutrition Evaluation Survey and the National Health Information Survey; partners with other components of NIH to enhance diabetes measures in ongoing studies; and offers support for investigator-initiated ancillary studies focused on diabetes. Of particular importance are collaborations with the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) to address the increasing proportion of CVD attributable to diabetes and issues such as balancing the cardiometabolic risks and benefits associated with statin use.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/101/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-13There is a substantial gap between the results achieved in clinical trials and the outcomes in real-world settings. This is particularly true for the minority racial and ethnic groups and low socioeconomic status populations that suffer a disproportionate diabetes burden. Addressing this disparity is a major focus of our multipronged translation research program. Newly established Centers for Diabetes Translation Research will serve as a key component of our program to translate efficacious research findings into practice and the community to improve the health of Americans with - or at risk for - diabetes. In addition, R34 planning grants and R18 translational clinical trial grants offer a targeted mechanism to test strategies to improve the delivery of evidence-based therapies to improve diabetes management or prevention. These programs test innovative methods to improve clinical care and translate research findings into cost-effective and sustainable clinical treatment strategies, including community-based approaches to make preventive measures as widely accessible and practical as possible. NIDDK has also partnered with CDC to support the Natural Experiments for Translation in Diabetes (NEXT-D) Study, a research network designed to test the effectiveness and sustainability of population-targeted diabetes prevention and control policies emerging from health care systems, business and community organizations, and health care legislation. It includes large-scale natural experiments or effectiveness studies and rigorously designed prospective studies of diabetes prevention and control interventions. The National Diabetes Education Program, jointly sponsored by NIH and CDC, plays an important role in dissemination and translation of NIDDK-supported clinical research.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/101/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-13Because knowledge of genetic risk factors has the potential for disease prediction, patient stratification, and insights into pathogenesis that can generate new approaches to prevention and treatment, NIDDK has expended considerable resources to apply state-of-the-art molecular and computational science to identify diabetes risk genes. Perhaps the most profound impact of these genetic discoveries has been in children with neonatal diabetes, who were often wrongly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and treated with insulin. Now children with mutations in the genes encoding the SURI and Kir6.2 subunits of the potassium ion channel that regulates insulin secretion are treated more safely and effectively with sulfonylurea drugs rather than insulin (8). Genetic testing for type 1 diabetes risk has made possible the TEDDY study and TrialNet prevention studies described above. The NIDDK-led international Type 1 Diabetes Genetics Consortium helped increase the number of identified risk genes and gene regions from 3 only a decade ago to over 50 today. The challenge now is to understand how this variation contributes to disease pathogenesis opening up new therapeutic targets.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/101/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-13For type 2 diabetes, we are encouraged by the DPP finding mat relative risk reduction with lifestyle change was as great in those carrying the high-risk TCF7L2 mutation as in other participants, despite higher rates of progression to diabetes. DPP also provided important pharmacogenetic data showing participants with a specific KCNJ11 variant or alterations in metformin transport genes were less protected by metformin. These observations offer the possibility of individualizing therapy based on genotype (9). However, despite substantial progress in identifying genetic variation contributing to type 2 diabetes risk in populations of European origin, there is a critical lack of information about genetic variation contributing to type 2 diabetes in disproportionately affected minority populations. NIDDK has established a consortium of investigators to identify genetic variation contributing to type 2 diabetes in minorities. With known risk genes explaining only a small fraction of the genetic risk for type 2 diabetes, the identification of epigenetic changes that may play a role in the transmission of diabetes risk across generations is assuming increasing importance.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/101/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-13Research has identified many pathways contributing to glucose-induced damage to endothelial cells including elevated flux through polyol and hexosamine pathways, accumulation of advanced glycation end products, activation of proinflammatory pathways, and inactivation of protein kinase C. Yet many questions remain about how these pathways may interact and converge to increase production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the mitochondria and how we can build on this new knowledge to develop therapies that can reduce ROS, reverse glycation, and lessen inflammation. Pathogenetic mechanisms, therapeutic targets, and biomarkers must be identified in specific tissues, including mechanisms of injury to specialized cells such as podocytes and pericytes. The relative importance of hyperglycemia and insulin resistance is of particular interest in understanding the link between diabetes and Alzheimer disease.

It has been proposed that the interaction of epigenetic changes with other persistent effects of hyperglycemia, such as glycation and oxidation of long-lived macromolecules, may explain this finding. Understanding pathways that contribute to metabolic memory may yield therapies targeted at the underlying molecular mechanisms. It may also help us learn about whether treatments that prevent the development of complications also prevent progression.

This information could yield undiscovered disease pathways and therapeutic targets, improve disease prediction over currently available clinical markers, and identify individuals for whom intensive therapy would be more or less beneficial. However, we know relatively little about genetic variation that may contribute to or protect from complications, and this is an important area for investigation.

Identification of specific populations of stem or progenitor cells affected by diabetes and the extent to which damage is reversible is vital for understanding how complications of diabetes might be reversed by stimulating formation of normal new vessels and regrowth of nerves. Differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells also holds promise for the repair of damaged tissues.

To address this challenge, NIDDK and NHLBI have collaborated in a number of major multicenter trials to establish effective approaches to reducing CVD in those with type 2 diabetes, including Action for Health in Diabetes (Look AHEAD), Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD), and Bypass Angioplasty Revascularization Investigation in Type 2 Diabetes (BARI 2D). Results from ACCORD and other recent large clinical trials attempting to prevent CVD did not demonstrate a benefit of intensified near-normal glucose control on clinical CVD events in people with moderate to long-term diabetes duration and moderate to high CVD risk. More information is needed on the impact of diabetes duration and preexisting tissue damage on the ability to respond to therapies. Beyond the practical management questions addressed in clinical trials, new approaches to uncouple diabetes and CVD must be based on a mechanistic understanding of factors linking these conditions, including obesity, inflammation, insulin resistance, metabolic perturbations, altered coagulation, neuropathy, and nephropathy, and how the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis differs between people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/101/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-13Impaired insulin production is key to all forms of diabetes.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/101/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-13The extent to which it is possible to preserve and/or restore Ã-cell function early in the course of diabetes and whether Ã-cell recovery is possible later in the disease remains to be established. Both the nature and optimal timing of interventions to preserve Ã-cell function and the impact on clinical care and outcomes must be addressed. NIDDK has recently established the Restore Insulin SEcretion (RISE) consortium to explore approaches to remission of insulin secretory function early in type 2 diabetes. Investigators will study both pharmacologic interventions and bariatric surgery. The Type 1 Diabetes TrialNet studies approaches to slow Ã-cell loss early in the course of type 1 diabetes. Specific immunomodulatory therapies have been shown to preserve C-peptide, and additional strategies including intense metabolic control with continuous glucose monitoring and pump therapy at onset of disease are being investigated.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/101/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-13Mechanistic studies are necessary to understand why Ã-cells lose their ability to secrete insulin as well as the physiology underlying recovery and preservation of endogenous insulin secretion. Particularly encouraging is the finding of some residual C-peptide production in a substantial proportion of patients with long-established type 1 diabetes. Such individuals might be amenable to novel strategies under development to stimulate islet neogenesis with the potential to improve Ã-cell mass and function. The intriguing observation of diabetes remission after some forms of bariatric surgery must be investigated to establish durability of the effect and the characteristics of patients and procedures associated with remission. Elucidation of mechanisms underlying improved Ã-cell function after bariatric surgery is being pursued in both human studies and animal models potentially generating new approaches to restore Ã-cell function. Moreover, the recent identification of platelet-derived growth factor as a factor involved in the replication of Ã-cells in early life that are lost over time offers a potential pathway to Ã-cell regeneration (11).

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/101/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-13Clinical studies of approaches to mitigate Ã-cell loss and/ or restore function could be accomplished much more efficiently if more reliable biomarkers or methods to image Ã-cell mass or function were available. The development of such tools has been and continues to be a high priority of NIDDK It may be facilitated by the identification of proteins expressed in Ã-cells and Ã-cell surface markers and antibodies through the Beta Cell Biology Consortium (http:// www.betacell.org). This consortium is pursuing a multifaceted approach to correct the loss of Ã-cell mass in diabetes, including cell reprogramming, regeneration, and replacement It is also supporting research to develop mouse models in which development and function of human islets can be studied. Also, because of differences between murine and human islets, NIDDK has established a resource, the Integrated Islet Distribution Program (http://iidp.coh.org), to make human cadaveric islets available to the research community.

Its ongoing trials aim to improve the methods of isolating and administering islets and minimizing the toxic effects of immunosuppressive drugs required for transplantation. NIDDK also supports collection, analysis, and communication of comprehensive and current data on all islet/Ã-cell transplants performed in North America, as well as some European and Australian centers through the Collaborative Islet Transplant Registry. This clinical islet transplantation research is entirely supported through the special appropriation for type 1 diabetes research.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/101/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-13A trans-NIH Task Force cochaired by NIDDK, NHLBI, and NICHD coordinates NIH efforts to identify genetic, behavioral, and environmental causes of obesity to understand how obesity leads to type 2 diabetes, CVD, and other serious health problems and to build on basic and clinical research findings to develop and study innovative prevention and treatment strategies. One key goal is to understand how biologic, cognitive, behavioral, social, and physical environmental factors interact to influence the development of obesity. For example, how do diet, exercise, and other factors influence reprogramming of neural circuits involved in regulating food intake and thermogenesis. Another goal is to identify distinct strategies that may be needed for achieving weight loss, maintaining weight loss, and preventing weight gain. Understanding responses to weight change that contribute to the very high recidivism to obesity may lead to effective strategies for maintenance of reduced body weight. These therapies might be quite different from those used to induce weight loss per se.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/101/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-13Childhood obesity has fueled the rise of type 2 diabetes in teens and young adults. An NIDDK-led randomized trial testing an intervention to improve nutrition and physical activity in middle schools serving high-risk children demonstrated efficacy in secondary outcomes, reducing BMI 2-score and other indices of adiposity. However, the primary outcome of the combined prevalence of overweight and obesity decreased in both the intervention and control schools perhaps due to information about the participating children's health, which was sent to all families (12). Family-based interventions have been successful for childhood weight control, but strategies for translation and widespread implementation of such interventions in highrisk populations remain to be developed. The roles of technologies such as smartphones and social networking and of community organizations must be evaluated for their potential to support individualized and tailored delivery of interventions outside of the clinical setting.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/101/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-13At the molecular level, there has been an explosion of knowledge about the mechanisms linking obesity to insulin resistance and excitement about potential therapeutic manipulation of adipose tissues based on the understanding of white adipose tissue heterogeneity, persistence of brown adipose tissue into adulthood, and metabolic flexibility of adipocytes. Tools and techniques have enabled researchers not only to define adipose anatomy and morphology but also to examine its dynamic function. Yet key questions remain about the mechanisms that determine adipocyte number and size, govern development and distribution, and link variation in body fat deposition to metabolic sequelae and macrophage recruitment and activation.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/101/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-13Particularly challenging but of utmost importance are studies to understand mechanisms by which obesity, hyperglycemia, or other metabolic factors in pregnant women may predispose their offspring to obesity or diabetes. Research is needed on how placental biology and the intrauterine environment shape neural circuits, adipose tissue, and islet development in the fetus. Studies relating differences in energy homeostasis and body composition to genetic variation and defining the critical developmental periods for imprinting maladaptive metabolic changes will contribute to understanding how metabolic fate may be programmed early in development.

NIDDK is pursuing this through clinical research on the response to various bariatric surgical procedures and through murine studies in which examination of defined procedures in genetically altered mice enables examination of the roles of specific pathways in the metabolic outcomes of these surgeries. Understanding the hormonal and neural controllers of energy balance will be key to designing potential drug combinations targeting multiple components of the regulatory system with additive or synergistic effects.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/101/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-13NIDDK supports numerous resources to improve the quality and multidisciplinary nature of research on diabetes by providing shared access to specialized resources. The NIDDK-supported Diabetes Research Centers, formerly known as Diabetes Endocrinology Research Centers and Diabetes Research and Training Centers, provide increased and cost-effective collaboration among multidisciplinary groups of investigators at institutions with an established, comprehensive research base in diabetes and related areas of endocrinology and metabolism. The National Mouse Metabolic Phenotyping Centers (http://www.mmpc.org) provide a range of complex exams used to characterize mouse metabolism, hormones, energy balance, eating and exercise, organ function and morphology, physiology, and histology. NIDDK supported research consortia, such as the Beta Cell Biology Consortium (http://www.betacell .org/) and the Nuclear Receptor Signaling Atlas (http://www .nursa.org/), provide data and reagents to the broader scientific community. Other important diabetes resources supported by NIDDK include a type 1 diabetes mouse repository at The Jackson Laboratory (http://www.jax.org/ tldr/) and Islet Cell Resource Centers (http://icr.coh.org/) that provide human islets for research.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/101/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-13Samples and data from the limited number of cohorts from large diabetes studies with well-characterized phenotypes at baseline and with longitudinal measurement of characteristics of interest are highly prized. To expand the usefulness of these major clinical studies by allowing the wider research community to access study materials beyond the end of the study or after a limited proprietary interval for ongoing studies, NIDDK has established biosample, genetics, and data repositories. Recently NIDDK has gone beyond the repository concept to create a living biobank, which provides investigators with the opportunity to obtain "on-demand" biological samples from selected individuals. This effort builds on the unique population of individuals at risk for the development of type 1 diabetes ascertained and monitored through TrialNet. The unprecedented availability of such samples and data may allow immunologists to understand early inciting events in type 1 pathogenesis.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/101/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-13Large clinical trials have established the long-term benefits of intensive blood glucose control in lowing the risk of diabetes complications. However, insulin therapy is burdensome and limited by hypoglycemia NIDDK has devoted considerable resources to develop technologies for accurate and rapid detection of glucose levels and appropriate adjustment of insulin delivery to create an artificial pancreas that simulates the functions of Ã-cells. Achieving this goal will require more accurate and robust glucose-sensing devices; more effective and rapidly acting insulin preparations; algorithms that align real-time glucose measurements with adjustment in insulin delivery; infusion devices that deliver insulin more effectively, conveniently, and physiologically; and fail-safe mechanisms to avoid hyper- or hypoglycemia It will also be important to determine the benefit of combining insulin delivery with the delivery of the counterbalancing hormone glucagon to reduce hyperglycemia, and how timely transmission and remote interpretation of patient data may contribute to safety and efficacy. Research is ongoing to assess the capacity of current artificial pancreas technology to improve overall metabolism, increase patient well-being, restore hypoglycemia awareness, and preserve existing pancreatic Ã-cell function, as well as to understand the factors affecting its use and acceptance in different age-groups.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/101/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-13Advances in sensors, processors, memory storage, wireless communication, and Web-based data transport, processing, and sharing have applications not only to new therapies but also to many facets of diabetes research in free-living populations. These range from instruments that measure energy intake and physical activity to the application of continuous monitoring of blood glucose to enable exploration of questions about the impact on human health of glycÃ©mie excursions, which may not be captured by HbAic measurement. Such studies could address the question of whether and how hypoglycemia may contribute to CVD events. Studies of energy balance would benefit from tools to define the neural circuits and molecular mediators that regulate energy balance by sensing and responding to signals of energy status and tools to quantitate mitochondrial biogenesis and turnover and assess mitochondrial function. To assess the progression of diabetes, measures that directly measure Ã-cell mass are particularly important because current methods are all linked to Ã-cell function, which may have both reversible and irreversible components. Complications research could benefit from tools for the study of extracellular matrix proteins and their interactions with growth factors and circulating stem cells or for the study of epigenetic change or glycation and lipoxidation of proteins. Appropriate systems biology and computational tools are needed to facilitate the integration of sequencing, expression, proteome, and metabolome profiles to identify key biologic processes and their interactions. NIDDK seeks to foster development of paradigm-shifting technology and truly transformative took through workshops, targeted funding opportunity announcements, and interdisciplinary research grants.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/101/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-13Diabetes is a universal problem. The impact of diabetes is rapidly growing among populations in developing and middle-income countries; without action, deaths and disability due to diabetes will continue to increase substantially. NIDDK promotes international collaboration between investigators in the U.S. and scientists in other countries to develop and test strategies to stem the epidemic of diabetes at home and globally. Many other countries have health care and medical records systems that are particularly useful for clinical research on diabetes. NIDDK has collaborated globally on type 1 diabetes research through networks such as TEDDY and TrialNet to expand access to research participants and gain insight from research collaborators. Genetic research on diabetes also knows no boundaries and our research efforts have benefited from combined analysis of international cohorts. Global collaboration on type 2 diabetes is particularly relevant to understanding diabetes in immigrant and minority populations in the U.S. International collaborations offer unique opportunities to compare effects of different environmental exposures and understand why specific populations may be particularly vulnerable to diabetes.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/101/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-13Daunting as the challenge of diabetes appears, research has tremendously improved outcomes for people with the disorder. Were it not for declining rates of kidney disease, amputation, and CVD in people with diabetes, the burden associated with increased diabetes prevalence would be much greater. NIDDK recognizes the importance of collaboration with other components of NIH, other government agencies, and the diabetes voluntary organizations to realize the research progress. Our challenge is to stem the growing tide of diabetes through research ranging from understanding the fundamental processes underlying diabetes and its complications to studies of practical approaches to combat diabetes in medical and community settings.

The result has been a Court ever mindful of the need for uncomplicated rules that do not hang on a thousand factors and are not dependent on a case-by-case analysis. The rules the Court has developed are simple and straightforward.

They do not need a warrant, but within 48 hours after an arrest made without an arrest warrant, they must bring the person who has been arrested before a judge.

You can't hope to use your time better unless you know for sure how you use it now. Most time-management experts recommend keeping a 24/7 (24 hours a day, 7 days a week) time log for a few weeks. Accountants and lawyers, for example, bill clients based on time; so if you're interested in either of those professions, think of it as practice.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-13Here's what you'll probably learn:

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-13Lee Silber, author of Time Management for the Creative Person, calls the calendar the "most basic, most indispensable, and often the cheapest tool" for planning. Buy one at any office supply store, download one from the Web, or make your own. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-13To effectively use a calendar, you have to do more than just write down appointments, tests, and due dates. For example, it's Thursday, and your math teacher has just announced a test next week. You get out your calendar and write TEST in big letters. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-13Most people stop right there, but to get the maximum benefit, you must now do some planning. Think about what you'll have to do to get ready for that test and when you'll need to do it. Put those items on the calendar too, scheduling more time than you think you'll need. Then fol low through with your plan. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-13All the experts recommend that you set aside time every week to plan the coming week. Then each. morning, plan the day, looking back to see what isn't done and forward to see what must get done.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-13If you're like most people, when you put pencil to paper, you come away with a very long "To Do" list. The simplest way to choose what gets done first is to set priorities. If everything on the list seems important, Greissnian suggests asking yourself some questions that will reveal your true priorities: 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-13* Will doing this It:ask help me reach a goal I have?

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-13Try to have no more than two top items on your list each day, say Ronni Eisenberg and Kate Kelly, authors of The Overwhelmed Person's Guide to Time Management. If something new comes up that you absolutely have to deal with right away, shift to that new priority, but be sure to reschedule the one that was on your list. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-13Items on your list should have time estimates so you can take advantage of what time-management expert Dave Allen calls "weird time," those little bits of time when you're waiting for someone or you're in between activities.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-13According to Dr. Robert Arnot, author of The Biology of Success, "Rituals are the foundation of success." He advocates turning every part of your life--sleep, meals, exercise, when and how you work-into a ritual. His point is that anything you can make into a habit or do as a routine frees your brain from worrying. Worrying uses up energy better spent on the work you need to get done. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-13Be patient-research indicates that it takes 21 days of repeating an activity before your brain switches to automatic.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-13If you think the only project you have to do is the one for the science fair, think again. Treat anything that takes more than two steps to complete like a project. Learn the VPIC process to effectively manage your projects. In To Do, Doing, Done! A Creative Approach to Manding Projects and Effectively Finishing What Matters Most, Lynn Snead and Joyce Wycoff describe the process: 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-13Visualize: What will it look like when done, and ask yourself, "Why am I doing it?" 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-13Plan: Break the project into pieces; decide who will do what-when and where. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-13Implement: Monitor your progress to stay on schedule. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-13Close: Celebrate and wrap up. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-13Some projects are just hard to get started on, even after you've laid out all the steps. The key is to get started: Pick the smallest step, the easiest piece, or the part that appeals to you. If worst comes to worst, set a timer for 20 minutes and get to work. Just start! 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-137 Pace Yourself 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-13You probably have already oserved that it's easier for you to do some things at certain times of the day and almost impossible to do them at others. Chronobiologists (scientists who study biological rhythms) have identified 11 am.-1 p.m. and 4 p.m.-6 p.m. as times of peak energy for most people, but you need to discover your own biorhythms. Do the easy stuff when you're tired, says Arnot, and "don't waste high-energy time on low-energy jobs." If you must work past your peak time, say Eisenberg and Kelly, take a refresher break-- go for a walk, stretch, phone someone who cheers you up.

His point is that anything you can make into a habit or do as a routine frees your brain from worrying. Worrying uses up energy better spent on the work you need to get done.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-13If you think the only project you have to do is the one for the science fair, think again. Treat anything that takes more than two steps to complete like a project. Learn the VPIC process to effectively manage your projects. In To Do, Doing, Done! A Creative Approach to Manding Projects and Effectively Finishing What Matters Most, Lynn Snead and Joyce Wycoff describe the process:

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-13Plan: Break the project into pieces; decide who will do what-when and where.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-13Some projects are just hard to get started on, even after you've laid out all the steps. The key is to get started: Pick the smallest step, the easiest piece, or the part that appeals to you. If worst comes to worst, set a timer for 20 minutes and get to work. Just start!

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-13You probably have already oserved that it's easier for you to do some things at certain times of the day and almost impossible to do them at others. Chronobiologists (scientists who study biological rhythms) have identified 11 am.-1 p.m. and 4 p.m.-6 p.m. as times of peak energy for most people, but you need to discover your own biorhythms. Do the easy stuff when you're tired, says Arnot, and "don't waste high-energy time on low-energy jobs." If you must work past your peak time, say Eisenberg and Kelly, take a refresher break-- go for a walk, stretch, phone someone who cheers you up.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-13April 08--The first World Autism Awareness Day was held at the Russellville City-County Park on Wednesday, April 2nd. This special day was held in conjunction with Autism Awareness Month. "Light it Up Blue" was the theme, and over 50 supporters came out that day to share a message and support those with autism. Blue balloons were released into the sky representing a child in the community with autism and someone who loves them. It was a great day and a great start to an event that is hoping to be held for years to come.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-13Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and autism are both general terms for a group of complex disorders of brain development. These disorders are characterized, in varying degrees, by difficulties in social interaction, verbal and nonverbal communication and repetitive behaviors. Autism is a complex neurobiological disorder that typically lasts throughout a persons lifetime. At this point, no known cure has been found and cause is simply speculation. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-13Autism statistics from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identify around 1 in 68 American children as on the autism spectrum -- a ten-fold increase in prevalence in 40 years. Careful research shows that this increase is only partly explained by improved diagnosis and awareness. Studies also show that autism is four to five times more common among boys than girls. An estimated 1 out of 42 boys and 1 in 189 girls are diagnosed with autism in the United States.

Moreover, government autism statistics suggest that prevalence rates have increased 10 to 17 percent annually in recent years. There is no established explanation for this continuing increase, although improved diagnosis and environmental influences are two reasons often considered.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-13We know that autism acceptance is something many in the autism community are also advocating for. Knowledge is power and bringing that knowledge to communities where those who have autism live, can make a world of difference in their lives and the lives of their loved ones. This is why April Haley- a mother of three boys, two with autism- spends her time trying to change perception, while offering understanding.

Oceania had fought Eurasia as an ally of Eastasia's, and vice versa. When it suddenly switched sides again, Winston and his colleagues in the Records Office had to erase the past, expunging all references to the wrong enemy.

All Winston knew was that when good news was announced, it usually signaled the impending report of a disastrous defeat. In the meantime, he drank vile-tasting Victory Gin or ersatz Victory Coffee and smoked badly made Victory Cigarettes. He lived in Victory Mansions, a run-down tenement.

They might mention the passage of the Patriot Act, which allows government agents to secretly search private homes, or they might question the long-term detention of foreign citizens.

Phil Chabot, who owns Pac N Arms on Emery Street in Sanford, was issued a notice of revocation in February by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The bureau got a warrant to search Chabot's store in February, and court records indicate he is suspected of making "straw sales" - sales through an intermediary - to a convicted felon who was barred from buying or possessing guns. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-13 Chabot has not been charged, and his lawyer said Tuesday that they had not seen any evidence against him. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-13 Chabot, who has been licensed to sell firearms since 1991, has accused the ATF of overstepping its authority and has run advertisements in local media, including the Portland Press Herald, asking any customer who is contacted by the bureau to call his lawyer.

Susan Collins, Chabot said an ATF senior investigator's review of his records "appeared to be little more than a thinly veiled attempt to create a registry of my clientele." His case also has been cited by bloggers who say the ATF is "terrorizing" gun dealers and trying to build a database of gun owners.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-13 "They speak with forked tongue and won't give us any good answers," Dean said. She said she has already heard from customers, but would not say how many or what information they provided.

The store is located in a nondescript former mill building and has no business sign out front.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-13 Federal firearm license revocations are uncommon. A 10-year review of ATF oversight, completed a year ago by the U.S. Department of Justice's Office of Inspector General, found that the agency revoked just 71 federal firearm licenses in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, 2011, a small fraction of the 123,587 licenses issued at the time to gun dealers, collectors, manufacturers and importers.

A woman's prospects for success, and potential pitfalls, in these fields was the subject of a panel on "Women Scientists at Work" held in March at the University of California-Berkeley.

My son is sick, and it's my day for child care'."

Because infinite amounts of time could be devoted to either, women must ration their efforts to avoid being overwhelmed.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/115/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-13As a scientist, you can get caught in the trap of feeling you have to work 24 hours a day in order to appear serious, Quinn cautions. "Reject the pressure that comes from your peers, who seem to be working longer hours than you are. They may or may not be." Keep space in your life for other things that are important to you.

Formerly an assistant professor of mathematics at Berkeley, she is suing the University for sex discrimination in denying her tenure.

Although women now receive 23% of all new Ph.D.'s in math, "the combined math departments of Harvard, Princeton, Yale, MIT, Berkeley, Stanford, Columbia and Cal. Tech. have exactly one tenured woman."

This view may be incorrect, she points out, and "the actions of these people can make it easier for you to get promoted when it's your turn."

"The time has come to support and encourage women faculty and students instead of building unfair barricades. I want to break that glass ceiling and resume my role as mentor and role model for female students," she explains.

On the other hand, even though it's a struggle, any life with meaning is a struggle, and that struggle brings a tremendous amount of richness to your life."

Four years ago she founded the "Systers List," a computer network now serving more than 1,000 women computer scientists in 15 countries.

Like many scientists, she finds that women do science differently than men. They are more collaborative, and more adventurous.

"So why not take that ability to challenge assumptions, and challenge scientific assumptions as well?"

In his plays, Aristophanes (5thc. BC) mentions sweetmeat pastries filled with fruit. They must have been very popular, as records differentiate a pastry cook from a baker.

In his 1st century cookbook, Apicius includes recipes that required wrapping 'pastry' around meat to seal in the juices during cooking. The practice of cooking food in pastry spread through Western Europe with the expansion of the Roman Empire.

Called a soteltie (subtlety), these masterpieces were created to surprise and delight. Remember the nursery rhyme containing the line 'four and twenty black birds baked in a pie'? That the birds in this beloved kiddies' jingle flew forth and began to sing once the pastry was opened may seem a contrived bit of fiction, but it's not. How this trick was engineered is quite simple: a cooked blackbird (or magpie) pastry was placed inside a much larger pre-baked pastry shell. Just before serving, live birds were placed in between the two pastry walls and a pre-baked lid was set on top.

This was especially true when royalty came to call. With littie more amusement than perhaps a morning spent hunting, dining was the chief entertainment. Strolling lute players and singers, meat carvers wielding knives as deftly as jugglers, and elaborate edible fantasies - like live birds springing at first cut from a humongous pastry - marked a household's sophistication and wealth.

At one time a Magpie Pastry was as ubiquitous as a modem chicken pot pie. It appeared at meals so frequently that the dish was simply referred to as "pie" since everyone already knew what bird the pastry contained. Eventually all crust-encased dishes were called 'pie' as well, regardless of their contents,

It suggests that the word is identical in form to the same word meaning "magpie." The connection is that a pie containing mixed fruit, vegetables and/or meat is similar to the colorful odds and ends that a Magpie picks to adorn its nest.

Declawing is like taking a hatchet to a hangnail -- literally. It involves 10 separate, painful surgeries, severing not just the nails but the whole joint, including the bones, ligaments and tendons. As veterinarian Louise Murray puts it, "If you look at your fingers, declawing would be like amputating the last section of each finger. If you were declawed, you would have 10 little short fingers. It's amputation times 10." 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-14Complications of declawing include chronic pain, nerve damage, hemorrhaging, bone chips, recurrent infections and abnormal regrowth of the nail inside the paw. Because cats have to walk on their shortened "fingers," declawing can impair their movement and balance and cause chronic leg pain and backaches.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-14Wildlife comprises those forms of animal life that are not   domesticated. Individual members of wild species held tame in   captivity are still considered    "wildlife"   as they are not genetically different from those remaining in a   wild state. Wildlife conservation and management is the   protection and use of wild-animal populations and of the land   necessary to support them to ensure that productivity and   ecological balance are maintained in perpetuity, while social   benefits are realized. Human activity has become one of the most   significant influences on the abundance and well-being of   wildlife.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-14The first European explorers and settlers in N America found   wildlife in abundance. This wealth was recognized as having   immediate commercial value, with    FISHERIES   and the    FUR TRADE   being the first widespread exploitive activities. As further   exploration revealed the vast, sparsely populated expanse of   land, it was believed that natural resources were unlimited;   hence, there was no apparent need to practise    CONSERVATION   .

The   practical result of this attitude became apparent in the latter   half of the 19th century.    WAPITI   once roamed to their eastern limit in Ontario. Land development   and uncontrolled harvest had extirpated them in that area by   1850. Wild turkey disappeared well before 1900, but only with the   extinction of the once abundant    PASSENGER PIGEON   was there sufficient concern to cause the passage of wildlife   conservation laws. While concern and consequently protective   legislation developed in eastern Canada, western and northern   Canada were still held to be boundless frontiers. Wapiti rapidly   diminished on the prairie; by 1890 only scattered, remnant   populations remained throughout their former western range. In   the 1820s    BISON   teemed in millions, defying counting, across the N American   plains. Their numbers remained significant to the late 1870s but,   by 1885, they were almost gone.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-14The people of Canada, however, still believed in the myth of   unlimited land and wildlife. Government and people were   preoccupied with economic prosperity, transcontinental railways   and Confederation. The    BRITISH NORTH AMERICA ACT   (1867) assigned resource-management responsibilities to   governments; wildlife is obvious by its omission, being lumped   under    "matters of private and local nature."   Wildlife enthusiasts of the 1880s solemnly predicted the   extinction of most large N American mammals, but the next 2   decades marked a significant turning point in wildlife history in   Canada. Following Confederation and the assumption of   resource-management control by the original provinces, a move was   made to develop wildlife conservation laws. The first national   park in Canada,    BANFF NATIONAL PARK   (est 1885), was not created to protect wildlife, although this   became one of its significant functions. The concept led to the   creation of Bison Recovery Park at Wainwright, Alta, and    WOOD BUFFALO NATIONAL PARK   , Alta and NWT.

This treaty led to the passage of the   Canada Migratory Birds Convention Act in Aug 1917. In 1919 the   Canadian government convened the first national wildlife   conference among various government representatives. The first    BIRD SANCTUARY   in N America (and perhaps the Western Hemisphere) was created at   Last Mountain Lk [Sask] in 1887; however, the declaration   establishing it remained essentially unrecognized until after the   signing of the Migratory Birds Convention Treaty.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-14Land and population protection through park and sanctuary   creation became a common solution, although not always without   heated argument and dispute. Sanctuaries have been created by   federal and provincial governments in key locations throughout   the country. Some notable coastal island sanctuaries for seabirds   have been declared on Bird Rocks,    PERCÃ ROCK   and Bonaventure I in the Gulf of St Lawrence, while many inland   sanctuaries have also been recognized. These areas were to   protect against overharvesting but they have come to reflect   protection of original habitats as well.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-14Between 1900 and 1960 considerable success was achieved in   wildlife conservation. The banning of commercial killing of   wildlife over vast areas, combined with favourable climatic   trends, has allowed for dramatic recovery. Bison were returned   from the brink of extinction. The    WHOOPING CRANE   population was protected from hunting, and its nesting and   wintering areas have been safeguarded. Whitetailed    DEER   now flourish in regrowth forests and in fringe agricultural   areas. Wapiti, aided by transplanted populations, have regained   strength in the mountain regions and in the localized areas of   the prairie that are associated with parks.    SEA OTTERS   have responded to protection from commercial overharvest.    BEAVER   have returned from dangerously low levels to become a problem   species, causing damage where populations are not controlled.   Through protection, northern tundra    MUSKOXEN   have shown a dramatic recovery, as have prairie grassland    PRONGHORN   .

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-14Wildlife management in Canada is a reflection of legislation   which can be divided into that concerning fisheries and marine   mammals and that dealing with other forms of wildlife. The   Fisheries Act of Canada provides that all fishes and marine   mammals in Canadian waters are the responsibility of Canada's   Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO). The DFO actively   protects and manages marine mammals (seals, whales, walrus, etc)   and offshore fisheries. Marine fish and mammal populations are   viewed primarily as a commercial resource. Legal harvesting   seasons and quotas on lobster, salmon and other species reflect   the continued monitoring of populations and harvest. Harvest   management, together with pollution-control laws, is designed to   maintain healthy, viable populations. The industry depends on the   sustained yield of a quality product.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-14To provincial and territorial governments are delegated the   active responsibility for inland freshwater fisheries, subject to   federal laws. These fisheries are largely managed as a recreation   resource for sportfishing but also have significant commercial   value. The Great Lakes and the larger lakes of the northern and   prairie regions support sizable industries, including the export   trade. Fisheries research is conducted by both levels of   government, often in concert with various universities.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-14Birds, land mammals, amphibians, reptiles, etc, make up the   second major group. Migratory bird conservation is managed in an   unusual manner, being conducted co-operatively by federal and   provincial governments under the authority of the Canada   Migratory Birds Convention Act. This law also ensures   international co-ordination. Migratory birds include    WATERFOWL   , cranes, shorebirds,    SEABIRDS   and birds generally grouped as songbirds and insect eaters. Other   land-related wildlife is managed and protected primarily by   provincial laws, when possible in co-operation with the federal   government. Nongovernmental conservation organizations and   individuals play an increasingly active role in wildlife   management and general wildlife education.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-14Population surveys are conducted regularly on a wide variety   of wildlife to allow management agencies to monitor population   trends and distribution. Surveys may be conducted on the ground   or from aircraft, often with the aid of photographic techniques.   The harvest of wildlife is monitored and recorded for comparison   with other population information, in an effort to ensure the   maintenance of optimal populations. Less visible forms have   defied accurate monitoring techniques. Sample counts, conducted   mainly by volunteer conservation organizations, provide some   insight into the well-being of these species.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-14The Canadian native peoples have been granted special-use   rights to wildlife through a varied and complex process of   treaties and laws (   see   INDIAN ACT   ,    LAND CLAIMS   ). While the continuance of existing rights has been assured by   the    CONSTITUTION ACT   , 1982, the exact rights of individuals residing in different   areas or being of diverse ancestry remains unclear. Supreme Court   of Canada rulings have clarified the rights in some areas, but   others remain unresolved, thus posing serious limitations to   individual resource users and management agencies.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-14Just as humans and domestic livestock require food, shelter   and space in order to survive, so do the various forms of   wildlife. Efforts are made by all Canadian wildlife agencies to   preserve and protect key wildlife areas on government lands.   Government agencies and nongovernmental groups operate programs   for the purchase of unique wildlife lands from private   individuals. If many species are to be maintained at desirable   levels, a means must be found of encouraging the management of   all lands in accordance with an awareness of wildlife needs.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-14Government wildlife agencies and public groups have formed the   Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada   (COSEWIC), which encourages and commissions studies on rare and    ENDANGERED ANIMALS   or on species of unknown status. Recommendations of the committee   encourage increased protection as required. Through its   membership in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered   Species (1973) (CITES), Canada is involved with most   conservation-minded countries of the world in the protection of   endangered species. Canada's increasingly urban society moves   most people away from direct interaction with wildlife. Thus,   there is need for an increasing effort toward wildlife   conservation and toward management education, information, and   interpretation programs.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-14Recovery of wildlife, primarily from 1920 to 1970, has   reflected societal concern which demanded active management   programs. Public and nonprofit organizations such as the    CANADIAN WILDLIFE FEDERATION   ,    CANADIAN NATURE FEDERATION   ,    DUCKS UNLIMITED   (Canada), World Wildlife Fund (Canada) and the Nature Conservancy   of Canada, at the national level, and their provincially based   affiliates, have played a significant role in concert with   government conservation agencies (eg, the    CANADIAN WILDLIFE SERVICE   of Environment Canada). However, populations have returned only   to those areas that remain suitable for their production.   Habitats suitable for population production have been the key   ingredients of conservation programs. Populations will not return   where land has been modified from its natural state through   agriculture or through industrial and urban development.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-14While many forms of wildlife are more abundant now than they   were in 1870, a number of species have continued to decline to   threatened levels or are in danger of extinction. Wetland   drainage permanently removes the habitat required by many   species.    POLLUTION   of rivers and estuaries renders them unfit for wildlife survival.      ACID RAIN   from industrial effluent stacks, automobiles and urban areas   continues to sterilize vast tracts of the land and waterways of   eastern Canada. Marine birds and mammals increasingly face the   threat of offshore oil spills and general pollution of the   oceans. The direct threat of uncontrolled harvest, so devastating   in the 19th century, has been replaced by the indirect, insidious   but permanent threats of environmental degradation that are   characteristic of the 20th century. If society wishes to maintain   wildlife in its variety and abundance, a place for wildlife must   be maintained in land-use planning and environmental   management.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-14The uses and value of wildlife to society are varied. Wildlife   is one part of the equation which, together with vegetation and   the nonliving    ENVIRONMENT   , constitutes the    "balance of nature,"   ie, the set of complex natural processes on which human survival   depends. A country fit for wildlife is a country fit for people.   Wildlife is a direct source of food and other products for many   Canadians. While this value is most apparent in northern regions,   it is also significant in southern Canada. Coastal and inland   commercial fishing, based on naturally reproducing populations,   is a significant industry. The wild    FUR INDUSTRY   provides a direct source of income for thousands, representing   the highest continuing economic return of any resource in   mid-northern regions. These harvest uses not only give direct   economic return but, provided their management is biologically   sound, also keep populations in balance with their food supply,   preventing overpopulation and dramatic losses from starvation and   disease.

Wildlife reflects the   condition of the environment and constitutes a    "barometer"   for measuring environmental change. Throughout Canada, wildlife   is the legal property of all Canadians. Its ownership is   entrusted in law to the stewardship of the various governments.   Sound conservation and management of all wildlife is thus the   rightful concern and responsibility of all Canadians.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-14Wildlife comprises those forms of animal life that are not   domesticated. Individual members of wild species held tame in   captivity are still considered    "wildlife"   as they are not genetically different from those remaining in a   wild state. Wildlife conservation and management is the   protection and use of wild-animal populations and of the land   necessary to support them to ensure that productivity and   ecological balance are maintained in perpetuity, while social   benefits are realized. Human activity has become one of the most   significant influences on the abundance and well-being of   wildlife.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-14The first European explorers and settlers in N America found   wildlife in abundance. This wealth was recognized as having   immediate commercial value, with    FISHERIES   and the    FUR TRADE   being the first widespread exploitive activities. As further   exploration revealed the vast, sparsely populated expanse of   land, it was believed that natural resources were unlimited;   hence, there was no apparent need to practise    CONSERVATION   .

The   practical result of this attitude became apparent in the latter   half of the 19th century.    WAPITI   once roamed to their eastern limit in Ontario. Land development   and uncontrolled harvest had extirpated them in that area by   1850. Wild turkey disappeared well before 1900, but only with the   extinction of the once abundant    PASSENGER PIGEON   was there sufficient concern to cause the passage of wildlife   conservation laws. While concern and consequently protective   legislation developed in eastern Canada, western and northern   Canada were still held to be boundless frontiers. Wapiti rapidly   diminished on the prairie; by 1890 only scattered, remnant   populations remained throughout their former western range. In   the 1820s    BISON   teemed in millions, defying counting, across the N American   plains. Their numbers remained significant to the late 1870s but,   by 1885, they were almost gone.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-14The people of Canada, however, still believed in the myth of   unlimited land and wildlife. Government and people were   preoccupied with economic prosperity, transcontinental railways   and Confederation. The    BRITISH NORTH AMERICA ACT   (1867) assigned resource-management responsibilities to   governments; wildlife is obvious by its omission, being lumped   under    "matters of private and local nature."   Wildlife enthusiasts of the 1880s solemnly predicted the   extinction of most large N American mammals, but the next 2   decades marked a significant turning point in wildlife history in   Canada. Following Confederation and the assumption of   resource-management control by the original provinces, a move was   made to develop wildlife conservation laws. The first national   park in Canada,    BANFF NATIONAL PARK   (est 1885), was not created to protect wildlife, although this   became one of its significant functions. The concept led to the   creation of Bison Recovery Park at Wainwright, Alta, and    WOOD BUFFALO NATIONAL PARK   , Alta and NWT.

This treaty led to the passage of the   Canada Migratory Birds Convention Act in Aug 1917. In 1919 the   Canadian government convened the first national wildlife   conference among various government representatives. The first    BIRD SANCTUARY   in N America (and perhaps the Western Hemisphere) was created at   Last Mountain Lk [Sask] in 1887; however, the declaration   establishing it remained essentially unrecognized until after the   signing of the Migratory Birds Convention Treaty.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-14Land and population protection through park and sanctuary   creation became a common solution, although not always without   heated argument and dispute. Sanctuaries have been created by   federal and provincial governments in key locations throughout   the country. Some notable coastal island sanctuaries for seabirds   have been declared on Bird Rocks,    PERCÃ ROCK   and Bonaventure I in the Gulf of St Lawrence, while many inland   sanctuaries have also been recognized. These areas were to   protect against overharvesting but they have come to reflect   protection of original habitats as well.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-14Between 1900 and 1960 considerable success was achieved in   wildlife conservation. The banning of commercial killing of   wildlife over vast areas, combined with favourable climatic   trends, has allowed for dramatic recovery. Bison were returned   from the brink of extinction. The    WHOOPING CRANE   population was protected from hunting, and its nesting and   wintering areas have been safeguarded. Whitetailed    DEER   now flourish in regrowth forests and in fringe agricultural   areas. Wapiti, aided by transplanted populations, have regained   strength in the mountain regions and in the localized areas of   the prairie that are associated with parks.    SEA OTTERS   have responded to protection from commercial overharvest.    BEAVER   have returned from dangerously low levels to become a problem   species, causing damage where populations are not controlled.   Through protection, northern tundra    MUSKOXEN   have shown a dramatic recovery, as have prairie grassland    PRONGHORN   .

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-14Wildlife management in Canada is a reflection of legislation   which can be divided into that concerning fisheries and marine   mammals and that dealing with other forms of wildlife. The   Fisheries Act of Canada provides that all fishes and marine   mammals in Canadian waters are the responsibility of Canada's   Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO). The DFO actively   protects and manages marine mammals (seals, whales, walrus, etc)   and offshore fisheries. Marine fish and mammal populations are   viewed primarily as a commercial resource. Legal harvesting   seasons and quotas on lobster, salmon and other species reflect   the continued monitoring of populations and harvest. Harvest   management, together with pollution-control laws, is designed to   maintain healthy, viable populations. The industry depends on the   sustained yield of a quality product.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-14To provincial and territorial governments are delegated the   active responsibility for inland freshwater fisheries, subject to   federal laws. These fisheries are largely managed as a recreation   resource for sportfishing but also have significant commercial   value. The Great Lakes and the larger lakes of the northern and   prairie regions support sizable industries, including the export   trade. Fisheries research is conducted by both levels of   government, often in concert with various universities.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-14Birds, land mammals, amphibians, reptiles, etc, make up the   second major group. Migratory bird conservation is managed in an   unusual manner, being conducted co-operatively by federal and   provincial governments under the authority of the Canada   Migratory Birds Convention Act. This law also ensures   international co-ordination. Migratory birds include    WATERFOWL   , cranes, shorebirds,    SEABIRDS   and birds generally grouped as songbirds and insect eaters. Other   land-related wildlife is managed and protected primarily by   provincial laws, when possible in co-operation with the federal   government. Nongovernmental conservation organizations and   individuals play an increasingly active role in wildlife   management and general wildlife education.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-14Population surveys are conducted regularly on a wide variety   of wildlife to allow management agencies to monitor population   trends and distribution. Surveys may be conducted on the ground   or from aircraft, often with the aid of photographic techniques.   The harvest of wildlife is monitored and recorded for comparison   with other population information, in an effort to ensure the   maintenance of optimal populations. Less visible forms have   defied accurate monitoring techniques. Sample counts, conducted   mainly by volunteer conservation organizations, provide some   insight into the well-being of these species.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-14The Canadian native peoples have been granted special-use   rights to wildlife through a varied and complex process of   treaties and laws (   see   INDIAN ACT   ,    LAND CLAIMS   ). While the continuance of existing rights has been assured by   the    CONSTITUTION ACT   , 1982, the exact rights of individuals residing in different   areas or being of diverse ancestry remains unclear. Supreme Court   of Canada rulings have clarified the rights in some areas, but   others remain unresolved, thus posing serious limitations to   individual resource users and management agencies.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-14Just as humans and domestic livestock require food, shelter   and space in order to survive, so do the various forms of   wildlife. Efforts are made by all Canadian wildlife agencies to   preserve and protect key wildlife areas on government lands.   Government agencies and nongovernmental groups operate programs   for the purchase of unique wildlife lands from private   individuals. If many species are to be maintained at desirable   levels, a means must be found of encouraging the management of   all lands in accordance with an awareness of wildlife needs.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-14Government wildlife agencies and public groups have formed the   Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada   (COSEWIC), which encourages and commissions studies on rare and    ENDANGERED ANIMALS   or on species of unknown status. Recommendations of the committee   encourage increased protection as required. Through its   membership in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered   Species (1973) (CITES), Canada is involved with most   conservation-minded countries of the world in the protection of   endangered species. Canada's increasingly urban society moves   most people away from direct interaction with wildlife. Thus,   there is need for an increasing effort toward wildlife   conservation and toward management education, information, and   interpretation programs.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-14Recovery of wildlife, primarily from 1920 to 1970, has   reflected societal concern which demanded active management   programs. Public and nonprofit organizations such as the    CANADIAN WILDLIFE FEDERATION   ,    CANADIAN NATURE FEDERATION   ,    DUCKS UNLIMITED   (Canada), World Wildlife Fund (Canada) and the Nature Conservancy   of Canada, at the national level, and their provincially based   affiliates, have played a significant role in concert with   government conservation agencies (eg, the    CANADIAN WILDLIFE SERVICE   of Environment Canada). However, populations have returned only   to those areas that remain suitable for their production.   Habitats suitable for population production have been the key   ingredients of conservation programs. Populations will not return   where land has been modified from its natural state through   agriculture or through industrial and urban development.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-14While many forms of wildlife are more abundant now than they   were in 1870, a number of species have continued to decline to   threatened levels or are in danger of extinction. Wetland   drainage permanently removes the habitat required by many   species.    POLLUTION   of rivers and estuaries renders them unfit for wildlife survival.      ACID RAIN   from industrial effluent stacks, automobiles and urban areas   continues to sterilize vast tracts of the land and waterways of   eastern Canada. Marine birds and mammals increasingly face the   threat of offshore oil spills and general pollution of the   oceans. The direct threat of uncontrolled harvest, so devastating   in the 19th century, has been replaced by the indirect, insidious   but permanent threats of environmental degradation that are   characteristic of the 20th century. If society wishes to maintain   wildlife in its variety and abundance, a place for wildlife must   be maintained in land-use planning and environmental   management.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-14The uses and value of wildlife to society are varied. Wildlife   is one part of the equation which, together with vegetation and   the nonliving    ENVIRONMENT   , constitutes the    "balance of nature,"   ie, the set of complex natural processes on which human survival   depends. A country fit for wildlife is a country fit for people.   Wildlife is a direct source of food and other products for many   Canadians. While this value is most apparent in northern regions,   it is also significant in southern Canada. Coastal and inland   commercial fishing, based on naturally reproducing populations,   is a significant industry. The wild    FUR INDUSTRY   provides a direct source of income for thousands, representing   the highest continuing economic return of any resource in   mid-northern regions. These harvest uses not only give direct   economic return but, provided their management is biologically   sound, also keep populations in balance with their food supply,   preventing overpopulation and dramatic losses from starvation and   disease.

Wildlife reflects the   condition of the environment and constitutes a    "barometer"   for measuring environmental change. Throughout Canada, wildlife   is the legal property of all Canadians. Its ownership is   entrusted in law to the stewardship of the various governments.   Sound conservation and management of all wildlife is thus the   rightful concern and responsibility of all Canadians.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-14Wildlife comprises those forms of animal life that are not   domesticated. Individual members of wild species held tame in   captivity are still considered    "wildlife"   as they are not genetically different from those remaining in a   wild state. Wildlife conservation and management is the   protection and use of wild-animal populations and of the land   necessary to support them to ensure that productivity and   ecological balance are maintained in perpetuity, while social   benefits are realized. Human activity has become one of the most   significant influences on the abundance and well-being of   wildlife.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-14The first European explorers and settlers in N America found   wildlife in abundance. This wealth was recognized as having   immediate commercial value, with    FISHERIES   and the    FUR TRADE   being the first widespread exploitive activities. As further   exploration revealed the vast, sparsely populated expanse of   land, it was believed that natural resources were unlimited;   hence, there was no apparent need to practise    CONSERVATION   .

The   practical result of this attitude became apparent in the latter   half of the 19th century.    WAPITI   once roamed to their eastern limit in Ontario. Land development   and uncontrolled harvest had extirpated them in that area by   1850. Wild turkey disappeared well before 1900, but only with the   extinction of the once abundant    PASSENGER PIGEON   was there sufficient concern to cause the passage of wildlife   conservation laws. While concern and consequently protective   legislation developed in eastern Canada, western and northern   Canada were still held to be boundless frontiers. Wapiti rapidly   diminished on the prairie; by 1890 only scattered, remnant   populations remained throughout their former western range. In   the 1820s    BISON   teemed in millions, defying counting, across the N American   plains. Their numbers remained significant to the late 1870s but,   by 1885, they were almost gone.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-14The people of Canada, however, still believed in the myth of   unlimited land and wildlife. Government and people were   preoccupied with economic prosperity, transcontinental railways   and Confederation. The    BRITISH NORTH AMERICA ACT   (1867) assigned resource-management responsibilities to   governments; wildlife is obvious by its omission, being lumped   under    "matters of private and local nature."   Wildlife enthusiasts of the 1880s solemnly predicted the   extinction of most large N American mammals, but the next 2   decades marked a significant turning point in wildlife history in   Canada. Following Confederation and the assumption of   resource-management control by the original provinces, a move was   made to develop wildlife conservation laws. The first national   park in Canada,    BANFF NATIONAL PARK   (est 1885), was not created to protect wildlife, although this   became one of its significant functions. The concept led to the   creation of Bison Recovery Park at Wainwright, Alta, and    WOOD BUFFALO NATIONAL PARK   , Alta and NWT.

This treaty led to the passage of the   Canada Migratory Birds Convention Act in Aug 1917. In 1919 the   Canadian government convened the first national wildlife   conference among various government representatives. The first    BIRD SANCTUARY   in N America (and perhaps the Western Hemisphere) was created at   Last Mountain Lk [Sask] in 1887; however, the declaration   establishing it remained essentially unrecognized until after the   signing of the Migratory Birds Convention Treaty.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-14Land and population protection through park and sanctuary   creation became a common solution, although not always without   heated argument and dispute. Sanctuaries have been created by   federal and provincial governments in key locations throughout   the country. Some notable coastal island sanctuaries for seabirds   have been declared on Bird Rocks,    PERCÃ ROCK   and Bonaventure I in the Gulf of St Lawrence, while many inland   sanctuaries have also been recognized. These areas were to   protect against overharvesting but they have come to reflect   protection of original habitats as well.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-14Between 1900 and 1960 considerable success was achieved in   wildlife conservation. The banning of commercial killing of   wildlife over vast areas, combined with favourable climatic   trends, has allowed for dramatic recovery. Bison were returned   from the brink of extinction. The    WHOOPING CRANE   population was protected from hunting, and its nesting and   wintering areas have been safeguarded. Whitetailed    DEER   now flourish in regrowth forests and in fringe agricultural   areas. Wapiti, aided by transplanted populations, have regained   strength in the mountain regions and in the localized areas of   the prairie that are associated with parks.    SEA OTTERS   have responded to protection from commercial overharvest.    BEAVER   have returned from dangerously low levels to become a problem   species, causing damage where populations are not controlled.   Through protection, northern tundra    MUSKOXEN   have shown a dramatic recovery, as have prairie grassland    PRONGHORN   .

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-14Wildlife management in Canada is a reflection of legislation   which can be divided into that concerning fisheries and marine   mammals and that dealing with other forms of wildlife. The   Fisheries Act of Canada provides that all fishes and marine   mammals in Canadian waters are the responsibility of Canada's   Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO). The DFO actively   protects and manages marine mammals (seals, whales, walrus, etc)   and offshore fisheries. Marine fish and mammal populations are   viewed primarily as a commercial resource. Legal harvesting   seasons and quotas on lobster, salmon and other species reflect   the continued monitoring of populations and harvest. Harvest   management, together with pollution-control laws, is designed to   maintain healthy, viable populations. The industry depends on the   sustained yield of a quality product.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-14To provincial and territorial governments are delegated the   active responsibility for inland freshwater fisheries, subject to   federal laws. These fisheries are largely managed as a recreation   resource for sportfishing but also have significant commercial   value. The Great Lakes and the larger lakes of the northern and   prairie regions support sizable industries, including the export   trade. Fisheries research is conducted by both levels of   government, often in concert with various universities.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-14Birds, land mammals, amphibians, reptiles, etc, make up the   second major group. Migratory bird conservation is managed in an   unusual manner, being conducted co-operatively by federal and   provincial governments under the authority of the Canada   Migratory Birds Convention Act. This law also ensures   international co-ordination. Migratory birds include    WATERFOWL   , cranes, shorebirds,    SEABIRDS   and birds generally grouped as songbirds and insect eaters. Other   land-related wildlife is managed and protected primarily by   provincial laws, when possible in co-operation with the federal   government. Nongovernmental conservation organizations and   individuals play an increasingly active role in wildlife   management and general wildlife education.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-14Population surveys are conducted regularly on a wide variety   of wildlife to allow management agencies to monitor population   trends and distribution. Surveys may be conducted on the ground   or from aircraft, often with the aid of photographic techniques.   The harvest of wildlife is monitored and recorded for comparison   with other population information, in an effort to ensure the   maintenance of optimal populations. Less visible forms have   defied accurate monitoring techniques. Sample counts, conducted   mainly by volunteer conservation organizations, provide some   insight into the well-being of these species.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-14The Canadian native peoples have been granted special-use   rights to wildlife through a varied and complex process of   treaties and laws (   see   INDIAN ACT   ,    LAND CLAIMS   ). While the continuance of existing rights has been assured by   the    CONSTITUTION ACT   , 1982, the exact rights of individuals residing in different   areas or being of diverse ancestry remains unclear. Supreme Court   of Canada rulings have clarified the rights in some areas, but   others remain unresolved, thus posing serious limitations to   individual resource users and management agencies.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-14Just as humans and domestic livestock require food, shelter   and space in order to survive, so do the various forms of   wildlife. Efforts are made by all Canadian wildlife agencies to   preserve and protect key wildlife areas on government lands.   Government agencies and nongovernmental groups operate programs   for the purchase of unique wildlife lands from private   individuals. If many species are to be maintained at desirable   levels, a means must be found of encouraging the management of   all lands in accordance with an awareness of wildlife needs.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-14Government wildlife agencies and public groups have formed the   Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada   (COSEWIC), which encourages and commissions studies on rare and    ENDANGERED ANIMALS   or on species of unknown status. Recommendations of the committee   encourage increased protection as required. Through its   membership in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered   Species (1973) (CITES), Canada is involved with most   conservation-minded countries of the world in the protection of   endangered species. Canada's increasingly urban society moves   most people away from direct interaction with wildlife. Thus,   there is need for an increasing effort toward wildlife   conservation and toward management education, information, and   interpretation programs.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-14Recovery of wildlife, primarily from 1920 to 1970, has   reflected societal concern which demanded active management   programs. Public and nonprofit organizations such as the    CANADIAN WILDLIFE FEDERATION   ,    CANADIAN NATURE FEDERATION   ,    DUCKS UNLIMITED   (Canada), World Wildlife Fund (Canada) and the Nature Conservancy   of Canada, at the national level, and their provincially based   affiliates, have played a significant role in concert with   government conservation agencies (eg, the    CANADIAN WILDLIFE SERVICE   of Environment Canada). However, populations have returned only   to those areas that remain suitable for their production.   Habitats suitable for population production have been the key   ingredients of conservation programs. Populations will not return   where land has been modified from its natural state through   agriculture or through industrial and urban development.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-14While many forms of wildlife are more abundant now than they   were in 1870, a number of species have continued to decline to   threatened levels or are in danger of extinction. Wetland   drainage permanently removes the habitat required by many   species.    POLLUTION   of rivers and estuaries renders them unfit for wildlife survival.      ACID RAIN   from industrial effluent stacks, automobiles and urban areas   continues to sterilize vast tracts of the land and waterways of   eastern Canada. Marine birds and mammals increasingly face the   threat of offshore oil spills and general pollution of the   oceans. The direct threat of uncontrolled harvest, so devastating   in the 19th century, has been replaced by the indirect, insidious   but permanent threats of environmental degradation that are   characteristic of the 20th century. If society wishes to maintain   wildlife in its variety and abundance, a place for wildlife must   be maintained in land-use planning and environmental   management.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-14The uses and value of wildlife to society are varied. Wildlife   is one part of the equation which, together with vegetation and   the nonliving    ENVIRONMENT   , constitutes the    "balance of nature,"   ie, the set of complex natural processes on which human survival   depends. A country fit for wildlife is a country fit for people.   Wildlife is a direct source of food and other products for many   Canadians. While this value is most apparent in northern regions,   it is also significant in southern Canada. Coastal and inland   commercial fishing, based on naturally reproducing populations,   is a significant industry. The wild    FUR INDUSTRY   provides a direct source of income for thousands, representing   the highest continuing economic return of any resource in   mid-northern regions. These harvest uses not only give direct   economic return but, provided their management is biologically   sound, also keep populations in balance with their food supply,   preventing overpopulation and dramatic losses from starvation and   disease.

Wildlife reflects the   condition of the environment and constitutes a    "barometer"   for measuring environmental change. Throughout Canada, wildlife   is the legal property of all Canadians. Its ownership is   entrusted in law to the stewardship of the various governments.   Sound conservation and management of all wildlife is thus the   rightful concern and responsibility of all Canadians.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-14The number of wild animals on Earth has halved during the past four decades, according to a new analysis. Creatures across land, rivers and the seas are being decimated as humans kill them for food in unsustainable numbers while polluting or destroying their habitats, the research by scientists at WWF and the Zoological Society of London found. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-14 "If half the animals died in London zoo next week it would be front page news," said Prof Ken Norris, ZSL's director of science. "But that is happening in the great outdoors. This damage is not inevitable but a consequence of the way we choose to live." The steep decline of animal, fish and bird numbers was calculated by analysing 10,000 different populations, covering 3,000 species in total. This data was then, for the first time, used to create a representative "Living Planet Index" (LPI), reflecting the state of all 45,000 known vertebrates. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-14 "We have all heard of the FTSE 100 index, but we have missed the ultimate indicator, the falling trend of species and ecosystems in the world," said Prof Jonathan Baillie, ZSL's director of conservation. "If we get [our response] right, we will have a safe and sustainable way of life for the future." 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-14 If not, he added, the overuse of resources would ultimately lead to conflicts. He said the LPI was an "extremely robust indicator" and had been adopted by UN's internationally-agreed Convention on Biological Diversity as a key insight into biodiversity. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-14 A second index in the new Living Planet report calculates humanity's "ecological footprint" - the scale at which it is using up natural resources. Currently, the global population is cutting down trees faster than they regrow, catching fish faster than the oceans can restock, pumping water from rivers and aquifers faster than rainfall can replenish them and emitting more climate-warming carbon dioxide than oceans and forests can absorb. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-14 The report concludes that today's average global rate of consumption would need 1.5 planet Earths to sustain it. But four planets would be required to sustain US levels of consumption, or 2.5 Earths to match UK consumption levels. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-14 The fastest decline among animal populations was found in freshwater ecosystems, where numbers have plummeted by 75% since 1970. "Rivers are the bottom of the system," said Dave Tickner, WWF's chief freshwater adviser. "Whatever happens on the land, it all ends up in the rivers." For example, he said, tens of billions of tonnes of effluent are dumped in the Ganges every year. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-14 Dams and the increasing abstraction of water also cause damage to freshwater systems. There are more than 45,000 major dams - 15 metres or higher - around the world. "These slice rivers up into a thousand pieces," Tickner said, preventing the healthy flow of water. While population has risen fourfold in the last century, water use has gone up sevenfold. "We are living thirstier and thirstier lives," he said. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-14 But while freshwater species such as the European eel and the hellbender salamander in the US have crashed, recoveries have also been seen. Otters were nearly extinct in England but thanks to conservation efforts now live in every county. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-14 The number of animals living on the land has fallen by 40% since 1970. From forest elephants in central Africa, where poaching rates now exceed birth rates, to the hoolock gibbon in Bangladesh and European snakes such as the asp viper, destruction of habitats has seen populations tumble. But again, intensive conservation efforts can turn declines around, as has happened with tigers in Nepal. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-14 Marine animal populations have also fallen by 40% overall, with turtles suffering in particular. Hunting, the destruction of nesting grounds and drowning in fishing nets have seen numbers fall by 80%. Some birds have been heavily affected too. The number of grey partridges in the UK has sunk by 50% since 1970 owing to the intensification of farming, while curlew sandpipers in Australia lost 80% of their number in the 20 years to 2005. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-14 The biggest declines in animal numbers have come in low-income, developing nations, while conservation efforts in rich nations have seen small improvements overall. But the big declines in wildlife in rich nations had already occurred long before the report's baseline year of 1970 - the last wolf in the UK was shot in 1680. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-14 In addition, by importing food and other goods produced through habitat destruction in developing countries, rich nations are "outsourcing" wildlife decline to those countries, said Norris. For example, a third of all products of deforestation such as timber, beef and soya were exported to the EU between 1990 and 2008. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-14 David Nussbaum, chief executive of WWF-UK, said: "The scale of the destruction highlighted in this report should be a wake-up call for us all. But 2015 - when the countries of the world are due to come together to agree on a new global climate agreement, as well as a set of sustainable development goals - presents us with a unique opportunity to reverse the trends.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-14On November 29, 1847, eleven-year-old Mary Anne Bridger, mixed-blood daughter of mountain man Jim Bridger, crept from behind the stove, jumped through the kitchen window, and ran around the back of Whitman Mission to tell Narcissa Whitman that her husband Marcus had been attacked. The frightened young girl had just watched a Cayuse warrior drive his tomahawk deep into Marcus's skull, hoping to release the evil spirits he thought dwelled there. Pandemonium reigned at the compound, located along the Oregon Trail near the confluence of the Walla Walla and Columbia rivers. Other settlers were shot, had their hearts ripped out, or were bludgeoned and left "with brains oozing out." Mary Anne hid in the attic as her friends, Elizabeth and Catherine Sager, watched Narcissa tossed in the mud, shot, and hacked apart. As the matriarch of the mission and the girls' adopted mother, Narcissa was singled out for mutilation; other females (young and old) were raped or taken as wives or slaves, and one fleeing child drowned in the river. In all, fourteen died and fifty-three were taken hostage, including the Sagers and Mary Anne. The violence was no more extreme than that committed by Indians and Americans in Oregon during the ensuing decade, but the Whitman Massacre, as it came to be called, assumed symbolic importance because it happened at a Christian settlement just as the region opened up to Americans.1

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-14This tragedy occurred in the dry interior enclosed by the Cascades and Rockies known as the Columbia Plateau, a remote and sparsely populated region that had been beyond the pre-1846 borders of the United States. By the time of the massacre, however, the plateau's southern portion was moving from "borderland to border." Since missionaries arrived just as the region moved from an inclusive frontier toward homogenous nationhood, and contemporary historians perceived them as instrumental in bringing American civilization to the region, a fresh look at the Whitman saga is a good opportunity for analyzing that transition.2

The hungry and sick people were also goaded to fury by his stinginess in trade and, more importantly, the recent surge of settlers into Oregon.3 While fascinating in its own right, the dramatic story of the tragedy and its immediate causes has overshadowed three bigger issues: the trader era leading up to the missionaries' arrival, the dynamics of which set the stage for the Whitmans' downfall; the martyred couple's impact on expansionist politics during the era of Manifest Destiny; and a subsequent debate between Protestants and Catholics over the importance of the Whitmans to the region's history. The obstacles faced by missionaries when they arrived in 1834 were rooted in religious, economic, and medical relations between traders and Indians dating back at least to 1809. The first two sections of this essay show how trade arrangements, threats of germ warfare, and religious syncretism in this earlier period undercut religious professionals like the Whitmans after 1834, and how other problems inherent in the evangelists' objectives and personalities stymied efforts up to 1847. The third and fourth sections analyze the massacre as a catalyst for U.S. expansion and its importance to the region's mythology and memory through the early twentieth century.

Whites traded, fought, preached, and lived with Indians amidst a backdrop of imperial ambition and Christian factionalism, leaving behind a historical record obscured by the smoke and mirrors of propaganda, conspiracies, and chauvinism. In the southern plateau's "middle ground," Indians did not play off imperial powers. They outnumbered the English (who were more concerned with beaver furs than settling the region); Spain and Russia were not serious threats; and U.S. settlers did not arrive until the 184Os. Oregon was an attempt by the British to do what they had intermittently tried already east of the Mississippi from 1756 to 1815-a policy of accommodation and exchange that contrasted sharply with the later American intrusion of homesteading, governance, and reservations.

The Plateau Indians' modern transformation was set in motion during the eighteenth century, long before the arrival of American Christians. By 1800, horses, diseases, and western goods had changed the cultures of the Columbia River Basin, and, like Europeans elsewhere, early traders encountered Indians in transition. By broadening their hunting grounds, horses improved plateau tribes' subsistence levels and knowledge of other regions, but also increased their exposure to pathogens for which they had little resistance. Coastal trade with Europeans likewise diversified their economy but brought disease. Sporadic epidemics converged from the coast and plains, wiping out entire villages and bypassing others as populations built up resistance over time. By the end of the nineteenth century, epidemics reduced the region's Indian population by roughly three-quarters, from approximately 180,000 to 40,000.4

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-14Diseases threatened the legitimacy of plateau shamans, whose task it was to "dream a cure." European epidemics did not wholly disrupt this system, but white medicine challenged shamans' methods just as their societies were overwhelmed by incurable sicknesses. Worse, epidemics often killed elders, the primary transmitters of oral traditions. White medicine was frequently ineffective, but Indians turned to it when their own treatments failed. The conflation of spiritual and medical care inherent in shamanry shaped how Indians viewed later Christians, since they presumably shared with shamans "the power of throwing their bad medicine at them, whether far or near, present or absent." As both a physician and missionary, the Cayuses held Marcus Whitman accountable for the deaths of his patients, especially since they suspected him of spiritual malpractice.5

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-14Along with epidemics, western goods such as iron axes, kettles, and wool spread to the plateau from the Pacific Coast and plains. When Lewis and Clark's expedition reached the Columbia River in 1804, trade networks stretched north to Saskatchewan, east to the Missouri River, and west to Chinooks on the Pacific Coast. After "Nor'Wester" (North West Company trader) David Thompson built posts along the Columbia between 1809 and 1811, direct contact with whites drew Plateau Indians further into the world market and familiarized them with Christianity a generation before they encountered professional missionaries. Traders learned the intertribal system of sign languages and mutually understood trade terms known as "Chinook jargon." Though filtered through this informal language, their practical correspondences and retrospectives contain a wealth of information on native religions and their own proselytizing. While still skewed culturally, traders' writings often lack the overt agendas of later missionaries.6 Their accounts reveal that Northwest Indians could absorb others' beliefs without sacrificing or contradicting their own religions, and they illustrate how whites manipulated that nonexclusionary flexibility to their advantage.

The fur market on the southern plateau was inconsistent, but the HBC controlled the Columbia River as a link to transport pelts from the Canadian Rockies to the Pacific. The HBC bought some furs, but mainly traded for dried salmon, produce, and horses for their own trappers to use; they also exported lumber to Hawaii and flour to Alaska. Chief factor Dr. John McLoughlin administered the company's most profitable North American enterprise, the Fort Vancouver-based Columbia Department. With thick white shoulder-length hair and steely blue eyes, the powerfully built Quebecer was a trusted and respected intermediary between Euro-Americans and the Indians, who called him Chakchak, meaning White-Headed Eagle. McLoughlin's early monopoly on firearms allowed him to regulate their flow so as to maintain peace between the tribes, and he helped organize the trade by giving Indians cardboard calendars punched with holes to keep track of European time. In return, HBC forts lured those Indians who were interested in trade, curious about Christianity, or just hungry or sick. The most popular trade item was tobacco, and some traders claimed Indians coveted it more than food or clothing. No business or diplomatic exchange was complete without smoking rituals and a gift of Virginia tobacco.8

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-14Indians were also intrigued by Christianity, and in 1823 the HBC mandated that everyone at the forts, white or Indian, should attend Sunday services. Living around the forts now entailed religious obligations, but Christian baptisms were offered only on the condition of learning agriculture. Encouraging agriculture seemed counterproductive to some traders, considering that their goal was to increase fur productivity, not crops, and many traders opposed the farms. But the belief that agriculture was key to conversion was common among Europeans, who believed in the moralizing influence of the sedentary lifestyle. The North American head of the HBC, George Simpson, initially had no interest in "civilizing" Indians, whom he saw as a lost cause, but he came around to the idea that farming would increase Indians' dependence on whites.9 Anticipating Protestant missionaries, the HBC paired Christianity with agriculture as twin pillars of cultural conversion.

In an effort to combat white dis eases and obtain tobacco, Plateau Indians began integrating into the white economy and learning white religion. Just as learning Christianity required practicing agriculture, getting medical aid required learning Christianity. The HBC presented European civilization as a package deal of trade, religion, and medicine. The English policy of offering medicine with a Christian string attached was not based on their sincere belief that religious conversions led to cures; rather, the HBC doctors' capacity to vaccinate against smallpox allowed them to manipulate Indians.10

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-14Traders exploited Northwest Indians' belief that the power to control medicine was potentially evil. At Fort Astoria trader Ross Cox observed Duncan McDougal, whom the Indians called "The Smallpox Chief," warning Indians that he had the disease in a bottle, and "if they did not behave, he would uncork it." Evidently this was a common ploy. In the 183Os a band of Nez PercÃ©s even begged a trader not to report an infraction to McLoughlin for fear that he would "send some plague among them." A Wishram, Martin Spidish, recalled the story of how white explorers threatened his people with smallpox after they stole a powderhorn mounted with silver and gold, and how they were then infected. Suffering from the disease, they took refuge at Fort Vancouver, where they learned "about Sunday and keeping track of the week."11 Threats of germ warfare, if not real instances, were thus introduced on the plateau thirty-five years prior to the Whitman Massacre, making it easier to understand how Marcus was suspected of inflicting measles on the Cayuse.

Iroquois traders who had incorporated vestiges of Catholicism before migrating west contributed to the syncretic religion that arose on the plateau. Also, intermarried white traders who mastered Indian languages proselytized and told biblical stories. By the mid-1830s most of the 2,000 traders, farmers, and mechanics employed by the HBC had married Indian women. In addition, the HBC opened a school at Red River (in present-day Manitoba) whose curriculum included the Bible and catechisms from the Book of Common Prayer, and whose alumni spread Christianity across the area.12

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-14Controversy over these intermarriages brought the first Catholic missionaries to the plateau. At first the HBC encouraged these marriages "after the custom of the country" (or Ã  la faÃ§on du pays) as a way to gain leverage within plateau societies. That changed in the mid-183Os when, reacting to pressure from local Protestants, the company board in London mandated that they hire missionaries to discourage these unions. The board sent an Anglican couple to Oregon, fittingly named the Beavers, but they were fired in 1838 when their renunciations of intermarriage alienated the traders. The HBC switched to Jesuits to placate their mostly Catholic employees and because they viewed their interests as being threatened by Protestant American settlers.13 As a result, Anglican England (specifically a company pressured by Protestants) promoted Catholicism in this remote corner of its empire. The HBC lifted its exclusion of "Black Robes" south of the Columbia River after the Beavers' dismissal, and Fathers Modeste Demers (from Belgium) and FranÃ§ois Norbert Blanche! arrived shortly thereafter. Father Jean Pierre De Smet came from St. Louis in 1840, and in 1843 Oregon became a vicarage apostolic with Blanche! as bishop.

When Catholic and Protestant missionaries arrived they met Indians already content with their blend of Christianity and native religions, skeptical toward farming, and wary of the whites' apparent power to inflict diseases. Local Indians also expected trade and gifts (especially tobacco) as part of any interaction with whites, religious or medical.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-14These preexisting factors and expectations complicated the Whitmans' efforts, but the presence of Catholics in the area also spurred them. Anti-Catholicism was rampant in the eastern United States during the 183Os, giving Protestants extra incentive for western expansion. In Plea for the West (1835), the Reverend Lyman Beecher portrayed the romantic West as a battleground in the competition between Protestantism and Catholicism. He appealed to evangelicals' sense of providential mission, warning that "the religious and political destiny" of the nation hinged on the region, and calling on Protestants to challenge Catholic churches and schools there. When Narcissa visited the cathedral in St. Louis on the way to Oregon she was disgusted by the "idolatry" of the mass and the priests' "embroyded [sic] robes ... of the richest material." The robes made her pause to consider "the many delicate fingers that had been employed . . . preparing vestments for such hypocritical characters." American settlement in the Northwest coincided with this "No-Popery" nativist upsurge and the latter Great Awakening, making Oregon an ideal focus for Manifest Destiny. Another writer pointed to Oregon as the key to the entire Pacific Rim, the critical steppingstone on the way to converting China, Japan, and South America.14

They juxtaposed their identity not just with Indians, but also British, Catholics, and non-Christian American ruffians like the trappers and vagrant criminals who fled to Oregon. By the 183Os New England Calvinists were removed enough from the frontier to be nostalgic about the Noble Savage, and mission statements were sprinkled with "pleas for the aborigines."15

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-14New England Protestants believed that Northwest Indians encouraged them to come west to propagate their faith. The crux of their belief was the story of Nez PercÃ©s and Flatheads (or Salish) who traveled from the Bitterroot Valley all the way to St. Louis in 1831 to issue a "Macedonian Cry" (appeal for Christian instruction). There they enlisted aid from none other than William Clark, then Superintendent of Indian Affairs. Supposedly, the Indians considered themselves a moral people and were distraught upon hearing from a pious trader that their mode of worship was wrong. The Indians lacked good interpreters, making it even harder to ascertain how apocryphal the stories were. Either way, Protestants and Catholics embellished the tale to suit their respective needs. For Catholics, the Indians requested Jesuit Black Robes to give Mass. Father De Smet answered the Macedonian Cry by going to Montana, where he hoped to start a "New Paraguay" modeled on the Jesuit's success in South America. A contrary Protestant interpretation spread through the Methodist presses of the East and into other denominational newsletters. The New York Christian Advocate even fabricated a lengthy oration depicting the Flatheads' request for the "White Man's Book of Heaven," including a letter and drawing by mixed-blood Wyandot William Walker. One subtext of the story was that the Indians' desire for Protestantism sanctioned the U.S. takeover of Oregon, which it then held jointly with England. Methodist Magazine published trader Ross Cox's memoirs in 1831 to bolster interest, and other Protestant presses exhorted their readers to rise to the challenge.16

The first American preachers to the area were Methodist Episcopal Jason Lee and his nephew Daniel, who accompanied Nathaniel Wyeth's fur brigade in 1834. Lee was accustomed to reading about heathens from the comfort of his New England study, and frontier life took him off guard. War between Flatheads and Blackfeet frustrated him on the plateau, and he moved southwest into the Willamette Valley, where diseases had depopulated the area and fertile soil lured American farmers.17

In 1820 they initiated missions among eastern Indians-the Osages, Cherokees, and Choctaws-but Indian removal and the corrupting influence of whiskey persuaded them to seek out more remote converts. The organization worked in tandem with Lee's Methodist Episcopal board. In a trip arranged by Samuel Parker, the ABCFM sent mechanic William Henry Gray, physician Marcus Whitman, and minister Henry Harmon Spalding to Oregon in 1836. Whitman and Spalding brought along their wives, Narcissa and Mary, who were the first American women on record to cross the Continental Divide.18 Gushing Eells, Elkanah Walker, and Asa Smith were rerouted from their Zulu mission and followed in 1838. Armed with pocket-sized Bibles and deep reserves of cultural and religious conviction, the industrious and committed pioneers set out to convert the Plateau Indians.

He chose a site near Fort Walla Walla, north of the Blue Mountains and near where the Jesuits built Saint Rose of the Cayuse and St. Anne of the Umatillas in 1838. Waiilatpu included a gristmill, sawmill, blacksmith shop, and school along with the church. The Cayuses had a reputation for strained relations with whites and war with other Indians. Spalding settled Lapwai ("Butterfly Valley") a hundred miles to the east among the more peaceful Nez PercÃ©s (Nimipu), near the Clearwater River, east of presentday Lewiston, Idaho.19 Eells, Walker, and Smith built Tshimakain among the Spokanes to the north.

They wrote more than traders, however, and their letters reveal several obstacles to their teachings. Some of their main problems, including misunderstandings over farming and trade, stemmed from differences between their policies and those of the trading companies.

They too denned civilization in terms of agriculture, and thought settled life was a precursor to conversion, viewing their crops, fences, kitchens, mills, and candles as embodiments of Christian civilization. Unlike the HBC forts, though, which were designed to foster dependence, ABCFM missions tried to decrease Indians' reliance on whites. Given that Northwest Indians had survived for millennia by hunting and fishing before the arrival of whites, the missionaries' presumption may seem unfounded, but it also underscores how diseases and famine had eroded plateau life by the 183Os. Some Indians planted potatoes, corn, beans, and melons and, at first, Narcissa was optimistic: "They are becoming quite independent in cultivation and make all their ground look as clean and mellow as a garden . . . they have a great thirst for hogs, hens and cattle." Most popular were seasonal crops that required so little tending that they did not interfere with traditional hunting and fishing cycles. But the region was arid, and the lack of timber precluded fences to protect crops from livestock. When the Cayuses and Nez PercÃ©s resisted full-time farming, their relations with the Protestants suffered.20

Aiming for an untapped region, the missionaries unwittingly stepped into an area where the HBC had already established the terms of white-Indian relations; Plateau Indians expected the new missions to serve as trading posts, since religion and trade were connected in their earlier dealings with whites. To the Cayuses, the building of Waiilatpu (or Whitman Mission) on their land obligated the couple to distribute goods, especially given the opulence of its cabins and furniture. When Narcissa complained that they did not help build it, "they murmured still and said we must pay them for their land we lived on ... something of this kind is occurring almost all the time . . . such as complaining because we do not feed them more."21

The HBC virtually wiped out the region's beaver, maximizing short-term profit and creating a "fur desert" to discourage American rivals from expanding west of the Rockies. (The British were willing to give up the bottom half of Oregon in 1846 partly because it was trapped out.22) The Protestants did not need to trade because they got their supplies from the HBC or ABCFM, and Indians now had less to offer anyway. The Indians' agency was reduced to supplying missionaries with potential converts or resisting the newcomers' presence. Overhunting also caused intertribal conflict. Plateau parties now rode to the plains to hunt buffalo, and the competition for the horses required for those trips fueled tension. The Cayuses were embroiled in sporadic war with the Snakes throughout the 184Os.

Most vexing on a day-to-day basis was communication, complicated by the plateau's linguistic diversity. Marcus learned some Nez PercÃ© but not Cayuse, while Narcissa lamented she could not "do much more than stammer" in Cayuse. Since the area had no written language, they translated the Bible phonetically with English characters.23 The missionaries filtered their discussions through mÃ©tis, who better understood the Chinookan lingua franca, but that jargon was constructed for basic trade and communication. The tangled web of Calvinist doctrine could scarcely be explained with chalkboard drawings or simple sign languages.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-14To the extent that they could understand it, Indians resisted that doctrine's emphasis on moral depravity and eternal damnation, and its strictness and unyielding piety did not wear well among people accustomed to freely integrating religions. Monotheism and prayer were popular ideas, but Plateau Indians resisted bans on polygamy and notions of original sin or the Holy Trinity. Narcissa spent an evening reading the Book of Matthew to one interested listener and "every word seemed to sink deep into his heart." The man considered himself a Christian, but she "feared the contrary" because he maintained two wives. The main mode of persuasion was to horrify Indians with threats of hell, but the Calvinists failed to make them understand that even those who acted morally and went to services would still go to hell if they were not regenerated. Asa Smith complained that the Nez PercÃ©s adopted surface aspects of Christianity by attending worship, but none showed a "proper sense of guilt in view of sin." Elkanah Walker likewise bemoaned that the "Spokans seem to have no clear idea of the wickedness of the human heart." Marcus tried to convince the Cayuses that their natural state was "lost, ruined and condemned," but his message, too, fell on deaf ears.24

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-14In Protestant eyes, the Indians' inability to grasp their inherent depravity was partly due to the absence of formal political systems in their society. Even the area's tribal names were mostly white concoctions based on village names applied to whoever lived nearby. To bring order out of this informality, the ABCFM worked in conjunction with a U.S. Agent of Indian Affairs, Dr. Elijah White, to graft a miniaturized republican government under the authority of Nez PercÃ© leaders. Like Walker, White expressed admiration for the Indians' intelligence and virtue, but found political structuring as elusive as the missionaries found regenerations. The two problems were linked: Asa Smith concluded that the Nez PercÃ©s had "no form of government, &amp; no law among them. Hence it seems impossible to make them understand the nature of divine law, its holiness &amp; justice, the nature of its penalty, &amp;c."25

Narcissa captured the urgency of her task in an 1840 letter when she wrote, "We feel that we cannot do our work too fast to save the Indian-the hunted, despised and unprotected Indian-from entire extinction . . . we have come to elevate them and not to suffer ourselves to sink down to their standard." The Whitmans' seriousness also made them difficult to approach, and many Cayuses resented Marcus's unwillingness to make idle conversadon and Narcissa's disgust with their lack of hygiene. One Methodist missionary wrote to Narcissa's sister that neither she nor her husband was cut out for missionary work. She was out of her element on the frontier, and the Cayuses "feared but did not love" the doctor.26 The ABCFM apostles found it hard to reconcile the Indian culture they idealized in New England with the Cayuses and harshness of frontier life. The pious Yankees' rigidity also manifested itself in their anti-Catholicism.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-14A big obstacle facing all missionaries was the coexistence of Catholics and Protestants, intensified in Oregon by the association of Protestantism with American expansion and Catholicism with the British-owned HBC. By the 184Os there were a dozen Jesuit missions on the plateau, including stations among the Flatheads, Coeur d'Alenes, Kutenais, Okanagons, and Kalispels (Pend d'Oreilles). The Jesuits' avowed policy was to disrupt the Protestants, and the ABCFM complained that their potential converts were coming under the "Papist" sway. The two branches of Christianity discredited each other's claims of biblical revelation, undermining the white claim to universal knowledge. A priest noticed that one Cayuse would grab his crucifix and make the motion of throwing it down whenever Marcus's name was mentioned. He may have been expressing his views toward Christianity, but to the priest his action represented ideas Marcus had been spreading about Catholicism. Father Blanchet drew mnemonic devices depicting the steps to heaven, with heretics like Luther and Calvin on an errant branch. Protestants quickly learned the power of drawings: their "ladders" inverted the Jesuit's by glorifying Martin Luther and depicting the Pope in hell as the Antichrist. Spalding relied almost entirely on ladders, and Elijah White sensed that Protestant-Catholic competition undermined his attempt to Europeanize the Nez PercÃ©s. Marcus, meanwhile, was concerned that Catholicism, with its emphasis on saints and relics, would hold greater appeal for Cayuses than Protestantism.27

As late as 1847, Marcus asked the Cayuse council if they wanted him to leave, offering to sell his mission to the Catholics, but the majority voted for him to stay. When Christian conversions did occur, though, they were often divisive within the tribes, especially since both Protestants and Catholics actively discredited shamariry. Only twenty-two Indians became official members of the First Presbyterian Church of Oregon.28 And because of Waiilatpu's location on the Oregon Trail, Indians rightfully associated it with the influx of American settlers.

Midwest farmers hurt by the panics of 1837 and 1841 hoped Oregon would afford them better opportunities, and settlers stopped at the mission to rest and replenish supplies before their final push into the Willamette Valley. In 1844 Marcus wrote that the Cayuses were growing "apprehensive about their destiny." The mission's population swelled that year when the couple adopted the seven Sager children orphaned along the trail, and at one point twelve families called it home, including Bridger's and trailguide Joe Meek's daughters. After the British ceded the southern half of Oregon in 1846, the number of settlers on the trail jumped from an average of around 1,000 or 2,000 annually to over 5,000 by 1847, doubling the Americans in the region.29

In the 183Os one of the ABCFM's primary goals was to save western Indians, but Marcus came to view the native population's displacement as inevitable. He wrote to his in-laws, "Our greatest work is to aid the white settlement of this country." Though the Cayuses were making "rapid advance in religious knowledge and civilization," their stubbornness in not fully converting to Christianity or agriculture conveniently rationalized the takeover of their land: "Indeed, I am convinced that when a people refuse or neglect to fill the designs of Providence, they ought not to complain at the results . . . they have in no case obeyed the command to multiply and replenish the earth and cannot stand in the way of others doing so."30 That reasoning made missionaries ideal agents of conquest, since wholesale economic and religious conversions were impossible.

Narcissa wrote that they "keep us constantly upon the stretch after patience and forbearance. We feed them far more than any of our associates do their people, yet they will not be satisfied." The laws the Bureau of Indian Affairs introduced at Lapwai were unpopular. Spalding ordered a woman who left her abusive husband to be whipped, but the Nez PercÃ©s thought that the husband should have been whipped instead for beating his wife. The Spaldings theorized that unruly white settlers who hated missionaries were encouraging Indians to steal animals and supplies. Indians "felt the lash" at both missions when accused of misbehavior, and some Cayuses fought back by destroying the Whitmans' irrigation ditches. When Marcus "remonstrated, they threw mud upon him, plucked his beard, pulled his ears, threatened him with a gun, and offered to strike him a blow with the axe, which he avoided." They wondered aloud why he could only maintain one wife, and Narcissa lost patience with them after the accidental drowning of their young daughter, Alice. She even discouraged Cayuses from worshipping inside the house because "they are so filthy they make a great deal of cleaning wherever they go ... they make it so dirty and fill it so full of fleas that we could not live in it." Suffering from Alice's death, exhaustion, and her own intestinal ailment, Narcissa dreamt of a house big enough that she could cook alone and "find a closet to pray in."31

On what later advocates called his "Winter Ride," he traveled south through snowy passes to hook up with a Santa Fe Trail caravan bound for St. Louis. In Boston the board chastised him for leaving his post but, with Samuel Barker's persuasion, retained funding for Waiilatpu. While he was gone Narcissa sent him what proved to be a prophetic letter: apologizing for her "womanish" fears, she wrote that she suspected the Cayuses might kill all of them, and temporarily took refuge at the Dalles Methodist mission.32 By the mid-184Os the Whitmans' initial optimism had waned, and they felt trapped.

After the main trail shifted south in 1844, usually only sick settlers visited the Whitmans. Then, in 1847, a worldwide measles epidemic entered the plateau via a party of Walla Wallas and Cayuses returning from California, where they had failed in their attempt to buy cattle, and Americans killed their leader's son. The contagion wreaked havoc among the Cayuses and white children before settlers carried it down the Columbia and it spread across the Northwest and British Columbia into Alaska. By November around half of the remaining 350 Cayuses were dead, far greater than the rate of local whites who were stricken. Traditional sweathouse treatments, in which patients jumped back and forth between steamed air and cold rivers, aggravated the Cayuses' measles. The sweathouses were good for arthritis and other illnesses, but not measles or smallpox. Some of Marcus's treatments were counterproductive as well. He overestimated the curative powers of cayenne pepper, and Whitman, Walker, Gray, and De Smet all practiced bloodletting. Gray bled a Spokane chief to death in 1839.33

Marcus was a doctor by trade, which strengthened the Cayuses' association between his spiritual and medical powers, and they suspected him of spreading measles. There was a precedent of perceived malfeasance because of Marcus's ill-fated attempt to poison wolves with arsenic-laced meat. When some Cayuses found and ate the raw meat, they accused him of poisoning them and burned down his mill. The 1847 outbreak confirmed the Cayuses' theory that Marcus went east in 1843 to get more poison. The "Prophet of Priest Rapids," a Wanapum named Smohalla, recounted this theory:

He was gone about a year, and after he came back strong and terrible diseases broke out among us. The Indians killed Dr. Whitman, but it was too late. He had uncorked his bottle and all the air was poisoned.

MÃ©tis traders "Old Jimmy" and Joe Lewis, who disliked Marcus, reinforced the rumor that he had poisoned the Cayuses. Though the Whitmans failed to persuade Indians on many matters, Marcus's success in convincing them of his powers now threatened their lives. The tragedy that followed showed how the Cayuses integrated western medicine and Christianity into their religion without overturning it.34

To Spalding's dismay, two days prior to the attack a Nez PercÃ© asked him if the Whitmans were dead yet. Despite ample warnings, fleeing was hardly an option-not with seventy people, including many children, under the Whitmans' charge. And arming the mission may have meant a battle rather than a focused attack, endangering more of its inhabitants and violating their commitment to pacifism. They decided they would stick it out until spring and then move to the Willamette if things did not clear up. In her last correspondence Narcissa looked forward to her parents' visiting Oregon: "I see already in their movements, indications that they will ere long come this way, for father is becoming quite a traveler ... it will not be long before they will be climbing over the Rocky Mountains."35

That afternoon his principal assailants, Tiloukaikt (meaning "Act of Lightning") and Tomahas, came to him under the pretense of a medical visit, but once inside they took out guns and hatchets and began their rampage. In all, some sixty Indians (mainly Cayuses), angry about Marcus's purported plot to eradicate them, took part in the massacre. Many of the victims died gradually during the night before a Catholic missionary arrived the next day to give them a hasty burial. His graves were too shallow, though, exposing their bodies to wolves, vultures, and natural decay before they were reburied the following spring. The ABCFM closed its missions and the Jesuits abandoned the Flatheads in 1850, ushering in a new era of syncretic "Dreamer" religions led by Smohalla that rejected western culture but incorporated Catholic rituals.36

Contiguous tribes distanced themselves from the Cayuses, some proclaiming their alliance with the "Bostons," a common term for Americans that refers to East Coast traders and New England missionaries (British traders were often called "King Georges"). The Yakimas sent their condolences via the HBC and promised to help apprehend the suspects. According to later trial testimony, the killers acted without permission from their elders, and some Cayuses pleaded for peace or even joined the American troops who were still searching for the culprits a year later. When a militia recruited from veterans of the Mexican War formed in Oregon City to hunt down the perpetrators, more militant Cayuses retaliated by burning down Whitman Mission.37 The murders and the difficulty tracking down the culprits moved Oregon off the congressional backburner and gave settlers a rallying point for the war that would be necessary to wrest control of the region.

In 1848 the massacre reinforced Northerners' arguments for organizing the territory quickly, martyring the Whitmans to the cause of Protestant expansion in a territory made hostile by scheming Indians, British, and Catholics. In the mid-184Os northern Democrats (and some Whigs) hoped that Oregon's settlement would counter the anticipated spread of slavery into Mexico. With the Mexican War underway, the Whitman Massacre was the cause cÃ©lÃ¨bre that allowed Democrats to revive the expansionist sentiment expressed in their 1845 slogan, "54Â° 40' or Fight."38

Meek's daughter Helen had died in the attack. After stopping by Waiilatpu to reinter the victims and retrieve some of Narcissa's hair, Meek crossed the Rockies in winter just as Marcus had five years before. In Washington he shared the massacre story with his wife's cousin, President Polk, and Missouri Senator Thomas Hart Benton, a longtime advocate of Oregon's settlement. In May 1848 Polk delivered the hair memorial to the House floor with a message that Northwest Indians had "raised the war-whoop and crimsoned their tomahawks in the blood of [American] citizens." Newspapers highlighted the melodrama and his speech struck a chord with Georgia moderate Howell Cobb, giving the territorial initiative southern support. The Oregon Bill passed the House but bogged down in the Senate because of the region's uncertain slavery status. John C. Calhoun opposed Stephen Douglas's attempt to extend the Missouri Compromise line and extend the 1787 Northwest Ordinance's ban on slavery to Oregon, while Benton and Sam Houston argued that slavery would not take root there anyway (Oregon's provisional government banned both slavery and blacks in 1844). Southerners tried to use Oregon as a lever to gain more control over California, while Benton argued that a territorial government would have saved the Whitmans and lamented the intrusion of slavery into every debate. Daniel Webster delivered an inspired antislavery speech and the bill passed after an all-night debate on August 13-14. After the House inserted a Free Soil clause Polk signed it on the basis that Oregon was north of the 36 30' line, and the United States extended its reach into the Pacific Northwest-the first U.S. government west of the Rockies.39 The news reached Oregon City on March 3, 1849, Folk's last day in office.

Oregon's new territorial governor, Mexican War hero Joseph Lane, urged capitulation and cooperation, reiterating the promise of the "Great White Father beyond the mountains . . . to protect you from injury and bad men." Lane promised "when you sell your lands your Great Father will not drive you away, but will wish you to remain near his white children and learn from them what is good and make you rich and happy." White-Indian relations remained tense across the region, though, because of the ongoing epidemic. Cayuses inadvertently spread measles by sending messengers to warn other tribes that the Walla Wallas brought it home from California, and settlers elsewhere feared similar reprisals to that experienced by the Whitmans.40

But in the small-scale Cayuse War of 1848-1850, they vengefully destroyed as much as they could of the tribe's horses, cattle, and food for two years before the Cayuses turned over eight young men. The Oregonians convicted five of the eight and gave them Christian names and baptisms before their executions. Marshal Meek symbolically cut their drop rope with a tomahawk in Oregon City in June 1850. Before the verdict, the defendants proclaimed their innocence and said that fellow tribesmen already had killed the murderers. They begged to be shot rather than hung on ropes "like dogs" and, in a final act of religious syncretism, likened their own deaths to the sacrifice of Jesus: "Did not your missionaries tell us Christ died to save his people? So die we to save our people." After McLoughlin testified for the defense, American legislators quickly stripped him of his land, including Oregon City (he died penniless in 1857).41

A loose intertribal coalition broke down and each grabbed what they could get: the Cayuses ended up on a small reservation east of Pendleton, Oregon, as part of the confederated Umatillas. Washington territory was carved out of Oregon in 1853 and its first governor, Isaac Stevens, tried to force all Plateau Indians onto reservations. The Yakimas and others resisted, and 1856 brought renewed violence that surpassed the Cayuse War in magnitude. The Yakima War merged with conflicts in Puget Sound and the Rogue River region of southern Oregon (where gold was also discovered), lasting until 1858. Northwest expansion would no doubt have occurred regardless of the murders or gold, but revenge contributed to the ferocity of the wars, with the Whitman Mission serving as the region's Alamo. Naming the Whitman murders a "massacre," which accentuated Indian barbarity, was an essential part of the Americans' moral posturing. The more emphasis Oregonians put on the massacre, the less obligated they were to respect the rights or cultures of Indians, and one focal point of fighting was broadly and loosely called "Whitman's Valley."

The Weekly Oregonian claimed that Indians were trying to exterminate the white race, "who have been all the time defensive." Avenging Waiilatpu and a Shoshone attack on immigrants near Fort Boise in 1854, Oregon's militia dismembered the neutral Walla Wallas' leader, Peu-peu-mox-mox (Yellow Serpent), skinning him from head to toe and drinking toasts to their attack from glasses that contained his ears. Even after experiencing the brutality of the Civil War and Plains Wars, Philip Sheridan wrote that he was still unable to "efface from [his] memory ... the dastardly and revolting crimes" perpetuated by Oregonians he had witnessed as a young man. Elijah White, who had found the Nez PercÃ©s unequipped for his version of civilization, considered the whites that followed to be violent drunks: "Never were a people more illy prepared for self government," he wrote.42 The phrase "massacre" was undoubtedly an accurate description of the 1847 murders, but not applying it to ensuing events spared early Oregonians a similar reputation for savagery. And with no memorable battle or catchy sobriquet, Oregon's Indian wars were overshadowed by contemporaneous events in Kansas, Utah, and the coming of the Civil War.

Fearing plunder at the hands of Americans, the company even retreated in 1845, relocating its headquarters from Fort Vancouver (across from Portland) to Fort Victoria on Vancouver Island. But after 1847 the HBC feared that violence jeopardized their interests, and their resultant push to clear missionaries from the plateau fed Protestant suspicions that they had conspired with Indians to kill the Whitmans. Since it was a Catholic, Father J. B. A. Brouillet, who discovered and hastily buried the bodies, some Protestants considered his proximity to the scene an indictment. Spalding condemned "these priests wet with the blood of my murdered associates" since so many were near the scene in the company of the murderers, and the Cayuses harmed none. In an interview with historian Hubert Howe Bancroft in 1878, Joel Palmer, the Oregon Superintendent of Indian Affairs and Cayuse Indian War Peace Commissioner, offered a variation on the poison conspiracy, theorizing that the HBC had injected strychnine into Marcus's medicine after he had given it to Indians.43

The pictures had captions stating that the Suyapa [Protestants] were poisoning the Indians as they descended into the fire. Spalding rejected the notion that the murderers were wayward youths unrepresentative of the Cayuses as a whole. One of the men Spalding and others accused of the killings, Tiloukaikt, was "on probation" for admission to the Protestant church and had recently given land to Catholics four miles from the Whitman Mission. On his wife Eliza's tombstone, Spalding etched, "She always felt that the Jesuit missionaries were the leading cause of the massacre." In one of his last letters, Marcus wrote, "I have been held forth to them [presumably by Catholics] as a sorcerer of great power."44

For Protestants the Whitmans "saved Oregon" by staking a claim and selling the idea to American politicians that the territory should be won from the British, Catholics, and Indians. Their argument hinged on the unsubstantiated claim that Marcus Whitman convinced secretary of State Webster and President Tyler of Oregon's worth during his 1843 trip, preventing it from being deemed a worthless fishery and traded to the British. Whitman did lead the 800-strong Burnett-NesmithApplegate wagon train out of Fort Hall (Idaho) in 1843, so his boosters could rightfully cite him as an important trailblazer, and he wrote the War Department in 1844 suggesting protection along the trail. Generous testimony for his role came from Edward Everett, U.S. Minister to the Court of St. James and negotiator of the 1846 treaty, who said "our country owes it to Dr. Whitman and his associate missionaries that all the territory west of the Rocky Mountains and South as far as the Columbia River is not owned by England."15

But while Marcus visited Washington in 1843, and perhaps met with President Tyler, there is no evidence he directly influenced diplomacy prior to the 1846 treaty, and the flood of settlers into Oregon was underway by 1842. The timing was close enough to make the theory plausible, but Protestants, like the Cayuses, misinterpreted Whitman's 1843 journey. It was Meek's winter ride and the Whitman murders, along with the brewing sectional crisis, which hastened passage of the 1848 Oregon Act. (Of course, if Marcus had not gone east the mission may have closed and the crisis would have been averted, perhaps stalling settlement.) Catholic historians, in turn, countered with the obvious fact that the U.S. government and citizens already knew about the Willamette Valley well before 1843 and, either way, the issue was embroiled in the larger context of British-American diplomacy. At most, they argued, Whitman recommitted a wavering Tyler to Oregon, but he never influenced Polk, and Protestants such as Spalding probably planted any contrary evidence in the archives. They might have added, had they known, that the ABCFM was lobbying the government on Oregon's behalf as early as 1838.46

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-14None of these counterarguments extinguished the Whitman legend in the minds of those with a stake in believing it. Propagated first by Spalding and Gushing Eells's son Myron in the mid-186Os, the myth crystallized in Congregational clergyman William Barrows's Oregon: The Struggle for Possession (1883), reaching its apex in Oliver Nixon's How Marcus Whitman Saved Oregon: A True Romance of Patriotic Heroism, Christian Devotion and Final Martyrdom (1895). Barrows failed to consult the ABCFM records despite residing in Boston, and Nixon's book took only one month to write. Nonetheless, both worked their way into Protestant-dominated public schools and, on the Fourth of July weekend, 1895, shortly after the publication of Nixon's book, over forty ministers in the Chicago area gave sermons about the Whitmans. Bancroft's History of Oregon (1886) dismissed the legend with a contemptuous footnote, but H. E. Scudder had already incorporated the Whitman myth into his widely used History of the United States . . . for Use in Schools and Academies (1884). Commenting on Scudder's adoption of the story (along with a painting of Whitman's Winter Ride), Eells perhaps revealed more than he intended when he wrote that "the truth learned by school children had been fostered by God and would be scattered so far and wide and deep that no combination of learned men or human reasoning could successfully oppose it." Likewise, children's author Hezekiah Butterworth prefaced his poem The Log School-House by the Columbia by conceding that "exact history has robbed this story of some its romance, but it is still one of the noblest wonder-tales of our own or any nation."47

Author George Weed had met Marcus as an impressionable boy in 1843 when he came through Cincinnati and attended Lyman Beecher's church. Weed contrasted the barbarity of Indians and materialism of fur traders with Narcissa and Eliza who, as female Christians crossing the Rockies, represented the vanguard of American civilization. A large illustration by Alice Barber Stephens shows the Whitman party celebrating Independence Day at South Pass in 1836, with Marcus proudly holding the stars-and-stripes overhead and a Bible lying open on the blanket beneath the women. The American Fur Company team who accompany them "pass heedlessly" on m the background for, though "American" in name, they think only "of traps and pelts . . . but the five true Americans pause in their journey . . . patriotic words are spoken as the Bible arid the flag are taken from the wagon." As for Marcus's trip east in 1843, Weed dropped his ABCFM visit to Boston altogether and portrayed him in Washington overcoming Webster's refusal to "vote one cent from the public treasury to place the Pacific Coast one inch nearer than it is now." When Marcus passed through Fort Hall on his return to Waiilatpu in 1843, he emboldened "a hundred [otherwise timid] wagons" to follow the pioneer through the mountains onto the plateau. Weed concluded by advocating donations to Whitman College, an institution he envisioned as the rightful bookend to Bunker Hill.48 The college never attained such symbolic stature, but the mission was consecrated as a national shrine in 1936 at the centennial of its founding.

Claims and rebuttals of the "Whitman Myth" filled Northwest newspapers in the late nineteenth century. Frances Fuller Victor incorporated the legend into her River of the West (1870), but critics denounced her as a "champion of secularists and Jesuits" when she renounced that theory in the 188Os. Catholics wrote articles and newspaper editorials belittling their rivals' "historical hairsplitting." Passionate arguments ensued over the naming of Seattle and Portland public schools and libraries after Marcus Whitman.49

Scholars at the 1900 American Historical Association meeting in Detroit debated the "Whitman Controversy," an interpretive firestorm that reached the pages of the American Historical Review. Historian John Fiske accepted the Whitman Myth, but changed his position after further study. At the same time Stephen Penrose, president of Walla Walla's Whitman College, was playing up their namesake's role to raise funds nationally. In 1903 the "Whitman Saved Oregon" interpretation was struck from Oregon's public schools by a Catholic, Thomas McBride, judge of that state's supreme court. In 1905 the HBC published a pamphlet denying their involvement in the murders, bluntly titling it The Hudson's Bay Company's Archives Furnish No Support to the Whitman Saved Oregon Story. In 1907 historians at the Oregon Historical Society condemned their forefathers' seizure of McLoughlin's land in 1850 and christened the HBC's chief factor "Father of Oregon" (a title officially bestowed on him by the state's legislature at the centennial of his death in 1957). In 1923 Catholics lodged complaints against President Harding for lending credence to the Protestants' "heroic balderdash" at a ceremony in Meacham, Oregon, dedicating the Oregon Trail. According to Harding, President Tyler found Marcus's "manly appeal irresistible" and, swayed by Whitman's "long ride and frozen limbs," decided then and there to pursue Oregon.50

Protestants viewed the plateau's Catholic missionaries as conspiring with the British-owned HBC that governed Oregon from 1825 to 1846 and viewed themselves as the appropriate vehicle for American expansion. While sectionalism, racism, markets, and population growth are rightfully considered motivations for western expansion, the Whitmans' experience and contested legacy shows how evangelicalism, anti-Catholicism, and Anglophobia combined to shape the northern version of Manifest Destiny. These ideas provided ideological grounding for the region's transition from borderland to border.

The Cayuse religion's overreliance on a supernatural framework to interpret all phenomena made it vulnerable when confronted with incurable diseases. In the wake of a measles epidemic that wiped out over half their people, the Cayuses transferred their tradition of killing suspicious shamans onto Dr. Whitman, who fit the role because of his dual status as a missionary and doctor. The missionaries' inflexibility and obsession with damnation alienated the Cayuses, feeding their suspicions just as their lands were being overrun. Though the Cayuses resisted the Calviniste' strict piety, the murders underscore their belief OT, rather than their repudiation oj\ the missionaries' religious powers.51 Consistent with their tradition, the Cayuses thought that Marcus Whitman was employing those powers toward evil ends.

Tyler referred to Oregon as U.S. territory just before Whitman arrived in December 1842, and Missouri Senator Lewis Linn had already introduced a bill calling for extension of U.S. control there. Neither Tyler nor secretary of State Webster cared much for the "distant desert" of Oregon in its own right, but they desired the harbors of Puget Sound to facilitate Asian trade.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-15"All organizations are merely conceptual embodiments of a very old, very basic idea - the idea of community. They can be no more or less than the sum of the beliefs of the people drawn to them; of their character, judgments, acts, and efforts," Hock says. "An organization's success has enormously more to do with clarity of a shared purpose, common principles and strength of belief in them than to assets, expertise, operating ability, or management competence, important as they may be." 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-15Some principles that worked for Visa: 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-15The organization must be adaptable and responsive to changing conditions, while preserving overall cohesion and unity of purpose. This is the fundamental paradox facing businesses, governments, and societies alike, says Hock - not to mention living cells, brains, immune systems, ant colonies, and most of the rest of the natural world. Adaptability requires that the individual components of the system be in competition. And yet cohesion requires that those same individuals cooperate with each other, thereby giving up at least some of their freedom to compete. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-15The trick is to find the delicate balance that allows the system to avoid turf fights and back-stabbing on the one hand, and authoritarian micromanagement on the other. "Neither competition nor cooperation can rise to its highest potential unless both are seamlessly blended," says Hock. "Either without the other swiftly becomes dangerous and destructive." 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-15The organization must cultivate equity, autonomy, and individual opportunity. "Given the right circumstances," says Hock, "from no more than dreams, determination, and the liberty to try, quite ordinary people consistently do extraordinary things." 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-15The organization's governing structure must distribute power and function to the lowest level possible. "No function should be performed by any part of the whole that could reasonably be done by any more peripheral part," says Hock, "and no power should be vested in any part that might reasonably be exercised by any lesser part." 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-15The governing structure must not be a chain of command, but rather a framework for dialogue, deliberation, and coordination among equals. Authority, in other words, comes from the bottom up, not the top down. The U. S. federal system is designed so authority rises from the people to local, state, and federal governments; in Visa, which contains elements of the federal system, the member banks send representatives to a system of national, regional, and international boards. While the system appears to be hierarchical, the Visa hierarchy is not a chain of command. Instead, each board is supposed to serve as a forum for members to raise common issues, debate them, and reach some kind of consensus and resolution.

Drinks other than milk and water should not be given in feeding bottles and should be confined to main meals. Children should be introduced to a cup at about 6 months of age and should have ceased using bottles by about 1 year. Weaning foods should be free of or very low in sugars other than those present in fresh milk and raw fruits or vegetables.

Because of the risk of erosion as well as of caries, frequent consumption of carbonated and cola type drinks should be discouraged. Fruit juices can also cause tooth erosion. Water and milk are the preferred options for children.

Fresh fruit and vegetables can also confer some protection against oral cancer. However, smoking or chewing tobacco and some other habits may contribute to periodontal disease and oral malignancy, and some chewed products containing sugars may predispose to caries.

However, many toothpastes contain fluoride, which is probably largely responsible for the decline in caries in many countries. Children under about 6 years old may ingest toothpaste, so only a pea sized amount of toothpaste should be used and the brushing supervised in order to reduce the risk of fluorosis (excess fluoride in developing teeth).

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-16Nigeria has more billionaires than any other country in Africa, including the continent's wealthiest man and the world's richest black woman, according to a ranking published this week. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-16 The collective wealth of Nigerians on the rich list compiled by Ventures Africa, a business magazine that "champions African capitalism", stands at $77.7bn (pounds 49bn), more than double that of South Africans and almost as much as the rest of the continent's billionaires combined. This year Nigeria overtook South Africa as the biggest African economy after a sharp rise in its estimated GDP, partly based on new sectors including telecommunications, manufacturing and the Nollywood film industry. Nigerians' dominance of the rich list will do nothing to quell South African anxieties that the country is losing its long-assumed pre-eminence on the continent and missing out on the "Africa rising" phenomenon that has led to spectacular growth in many nations over the past decade. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-16 Of 55 billionaires in Africa Nigeria boasts 23 while South Africa and Egypt each have eight. Their net worth totals $161.7bn, up 12.4% from $143.8bn on Ventures Africa's first list in 2013. Of five new billionaires added this year, four are Nigerian. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-16 Aliko Dangote, founder of Africa's biggest industrial conglomerate, Dangote Group, remains the continent's richest man. His net worth has grown to $25.7bn in 2014, a 21% rise from 2013. Number four on the list is Folorunsho Alakija of Nigeria, whose $7.3bn, generated from oil and gas, puts her ahead of America's Oprah Winfrey as the richest black woman in the world, according to Ventures Africa. Critics of the African success story argue that growth has widened inequality, with Nigeria a prime example.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-16Nearly five years into the recovery from the Great Recession, the American economy remains fundamentally broken. Inequality is getting worse: Ninety-five percent of income gains since 2009 have gone to the top one percent of earners. Private employers have added more than 8 million jobs, but nearly two-thirds are low-wage positions. The American worker's share of the national income is as low as it's been in the six decades since World War II. But even as most Americans struggle just to tread water, corporate profits have soared to record highs.

And that wage itself has lost more than 12 percent of its value since it was last hiked to $7.25 in 2007, due to inflation. In a more prosperous era, the stereotype of a minimum-wage worker was a teenager flipping burgers, earning a little beer money on the side. But in the new American economy, dominated by low-wage service jobs, fewer than one in four minimum-wage workers are teens. More than half are 25 or older. "The demographics have shifted," says Rep. George Miller, ranking Democrat on the House labor committee. "These are now important wage earners in their families."

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-16As a matter of public policy, the solution is obvious. There are few government interventions that can match the elegance of a higher minimum wage. It boosts the fortunes of the working poor and the economy at large, with minimal trade-offs. Raising the minimum wage does little or nothing to dampen job growth. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that an increase to $10.10 would trim payrolls by less than one-third of one percent, even as it lifts nearly 1 million Americans out of poverty.

Supported by more than 70 percent of Americans, the policy achieves both liberal and conservative goals: It alleviates poverty even as it underscores the value of hard work. It reduces corporate welfare even as it lessens dependence on the social safety net. Today, taxpayers are shelling out nearly $250 billion a year on welfare programs for the working poor. Nearly 40 percent of food stamps are paid out to households with at least one wage earner.

The issue unites progressives and independents even as it drives a wedge between mainstream Republicans and Tea Party extremists. In his January State of the Union address, President Obama threw down the gauntlet, calling on the GOP to join Democrats in increasing the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour. "Say yes," Obama said. "Give America a raise."

That represents a pay cut, in real terms, of more than 30 percent from 1968's bottom wage. That decline in the value of the minimum wage has been a key driver of income inequality. "And unlike inequality that's been brought about by technological change or globalization," says Arindrajit Dube, labor economist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, "we could have prevented it just by pegging the minimum wage to the cost of living."

In previous decades, the minimum wage kept pace with advances in productivity; as workers created more value for a company, they gained, too. Had the minimum wage tracked productivity gains since 1968, it would now stand above $20 an hour. More telling: Had workers on the lowest rung kept pace with the gains that have accrued to the one percent, it would have vaulted past $30 in 2007.

A family of four trying to live on the earnings of a minimum-wage worker - $15,080 a year - falls more than $8,000 below the poverty line. As a result, today's minimum-wage workers are really expensive for the rest of us. They have to rely on taxpayers to supplement their subpoverty wages.

A recent University of California, Berkeley study reveals that the nation's largest fast-food chains earn $7 billion a year in inflated profits because the rest of us pick up the tab for the food stamps, housing vouchers, tax credits and Medicaid benefits that the businesses refuse to cover by paying adequate wages. Big-box stores get an even sweeter deal. A federal analysis of a Walmart Supercenter in Wisconsin found that safety-net subsidies ran approximately $5,500 per lowwage associate. If that's representative, every Supercenter in America is enjoying a rolling bailout of nearly $1 million a year.

"The large restaurant chains, the Walmarts - they hold themselves up as captains of the freeenterprise system," Rep. Miller says, "but their whole business plan is dependent on using the social safety net."

The EITC lifts millions out of poverty. But thanks to the inadequacy of the minimum wage, it also creates a perverse incentive. The EITC subsidizes poverty-wage work, so businesses can - and do - drive wages even further below the poverty line.

Worse: The EITC actually hurts many single workers without kids, who don't qualify for the subsidy and are made strictly worse off by its existence. A RISING MINIMUM WAGE IS A TIDE

This is common sense: If a shift worker gets a raise and is now making what the line manager has earned, the line manager is also going to get a bump in pay. Raise the minimum wage, and the bottom 20 percent of wage earners soon enjoy larger paychecks, says Dube of UMass.

Far from the image of a teen flipping burgers at Jack in the Box, the median worker who would benefit is a full-time working woman in her thirties, responsible for half of her family's income.

If not a living wage, that's at least enough to pull a family of three above the poverty line. According to Dube's math, this boost in wages would drive a 10 percent reduction in poverty - pushing the official poverty rate back down where it was before Bear Stearns.

As House Speaker John Boehner put it, "When you raise the price of employment, guess what happens? You get less of it." His line is echoed by many of the party's potential 2016 presidential contenders. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz calls it "wrongheaded"; Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul claims it will hurt the "least-skilled people in our society"; and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio declares that "raising the minimum wage does not grow the middle class."

Texas Rep. Joe Barton recently declared that the minimum wage has "outlived its usefulness." In a sign of how far the national GOP has tilted to the extreme right, such outrÃ© notions are now being advanced by senators long regarded as moderates. Last June, Lamar Alexander - the GOP's ranking member on the Senate labor committee - announced, "I don't believe" in the minimum wage, insisting that employers should be able to get away with paying $2 an hour.

The minimum wage is the most exhaustively researched subject in economics. Social scientists have scrutinized bordering counties that run along state lines - think Washington and Idaho - measuring what happens when one state boosts its minimum wage and the other doesn't. The results are in: A 2013 meta-analysis of minimum-wage studies by the Center for Economic Policy and Research concludes that higher minimum wages "have no discernible effect on employment." To the degree that mainstream economists still debate the topic, says Dube, it's whether the jobs impact is "fairly small or something close to zero."

Yet even Neumark himself does not oppose minimum-wage hikes. "It doesn't mean we shouldn't do it," he said, announcing his study. "If 10 workers lost their jobs but 1,000 families were lifted out of poverty, we'd probably say that was a pretty good trade-off."

If accurate, that jobs number is nothing to scoff at. But for a sense of perspective, consider that the CBO also estimated that the GOP-led sequester killed 750,000jobs last year, providing zero benefit to the economy. In contrast, the CBO minimum-wage report calculates that for every disadvantaged job seeker, 33 workers would receive a fatter paycheck. Taken as a group, the nation's low-wage workforce would have an extra $31 billion to spend every year, stimulating the economy. "The bottom line from the CBO report," says Larry Katz, a Harvard economist, "is that for the vast majority of Americans, an increase to $10.10 is a big win."

Jobs loading up the deep-fat fryer, changing bedpans and mopping floors can't be shipped to Bangladesh or cheaply automated. The dark reality of the American economy today is that globalization has already done its number on us. "These are the jobs that are left, and they're left for a reason," says Dube. "Barring teleportation," he says, laughing, these jobs will have to be filled in America even at higher wages.

Better pay leads to quicker hiring, reduced turnover and happier workers. The success of high- wage discount retailers like Costco demonstrates that livable wages and low prices aren't mutually exclusive. But even if every penny of increased labor costs were passed on to shoppers, the results wouldn't give anyone sticker shock. A UC Berkeley study found Walmart could finance a pay hike to $12 an hour for its nearly 1 million low-wage associates by boosting prices just 1.1 percent - at a cost to the average shopper of just $12.49 a year, or the price of a bag of Cat Chow.

On Election Day, boosted by unusually high turnout, McCaskill secured a 50,000vote victory.

Quite apart from the obvious economic benefits, the political goal is to give the party's base voters - who often sit out nonpresidential elections - some skin in the game on Election Day.

The Republican is facing a well-funded primary challenge from the far right, and has chosen to prove his conservative mettle by denouncing a minimum-wage increase as the "last thing we should do."

But is $10.10 really the best that America can do by its poorest workers? The experience of other advanced democracies suggests that the minimum wage could rise far higher still. In Australia, the minimum wage is now greater than US$16 an hour, yet the unemployment rate Down Under - 5.8 percent - is signif-icantly lower than our own.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-16Nationwide, there is one high-profile campaign to push the minimum wage significantly above $10.10. Ironically, this leadership is coming from the conservative end of the spectrum. Ron Unz, a Republican multimillionaire from Silicon Valley, is advancing a ballot measure to hike California's minimum wage to $12 an hour.

But Unz has since embraced livable wages on the economic merits alone - arguing that no American should be forced to subsidize the labor costs of profitable corporations. Unz has especially harsh words for those, like Florida's freshman senator, who would increase the Earned Income Tax Credit instead of forcing Walmart to pay honest wages. "Why should all taxpayers pay for massive, hidden government subsidies?" he asks. "But that's what Marco Rubio and fellow Republicans are calling for: an increase in welfare spending!"

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-11-16In the past, conservative opposition to higher minimum wages was premised on the fear that they would drive an increase in joblessness, creating greater dependency on the welfare state, Unz says. But now that hard economic data prove the opposite case - that higher hourly wages don't kill job growth and simultaneously reduce reliance on Uncle Sugar - Unz believes there's no reason this policy shouldn't unite both bleeding-heart liberals and Mitt Romney conservatives, who fret about the freeloading of the 47 percent of Americans who don't pay income taxes.
