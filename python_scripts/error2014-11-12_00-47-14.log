M. Forster; the playwright and composer Noel Coward; and the Boy Scouts' leader and founder Robert Baden-Powell.

A "Proclamation to the People of England," personally signed by Brauchitsch, added a more specific threat. "I warn all civil- ians that if they undertake active operations against the German forces, they will be condemned to death inexorably." If it was a bluff, it was a bluff Great Britain had no choice but to take with deadly seriousness. In late June 1940, imagining the worst, Churchill ordered preparations for Britain's last stand: in complete secrecy, an underground army would be organized, trained, and equipped, with the mission of waging desperate guerrilla warfare behind the enemy's lines if the invasion came. The man who would lead the effort, Maj. Colin McVean Gubbins, told his officers to scour the country for men "who knew the forests, the woods, the mines, the old closed shafts, the hills, the moors, the glens - people who know their local stuff." Within weeks, the first cells of Britain's resistance-movementto-be were digging hideouts, preparing explosive booby traps, and steeling themselves for a battle in which neither side would show the least mercy.

The British naval staff warned that even the full might of the Royal Navy, still the most powerful in the world, could not prevent the Germans from bringing ashore 100,000 troops in an initial landing. Although 190,000 of the 250,000 British troops sent to France had made it back safely following the evacuation at Dunkirk in June 1940 (as well as some 140,000 French troops), almost none of their tanks, artillery, or antitank weapons had made it back with them.

Gen. Erwin Rommel was to lead one of the panzer columns that would encircle London in a blitzkrieg pincer movement. Two airborne divisions would seize and bridge the Royal Military Canal - a barrier created during the Napoleonic Wars to stop the French, and a significant antitank obstacle between the south coast and London.

There were only 350 tanks in the whole country, far too few to cover hundreds of miles of coast- line with the mobile reserve that was the linchpin of a success- ful counterattack. There were fewer than 200 antitank guns in Britain, and Churchill himself instructed that given the extreme shortage of antitank rounds - one crew he inspected had only six per gun - not a single one could be spared for practice, even to acquaint the crews with how their weapons worked. "Fire should be held for the last moment at the closest range," the prime minister ordered.

It would be the source of jokes throughout the war - Noel Coward wrote a humorous ditty portraying an elderly Home Guard colonel writing a beseeching letter to the minister of supply: "Would you please oblige us with a Bren gun?" But 1.5 million men promptly volunteered, underscoring the dead earnest in which the country took the invasion threat.

Within weeks, all indications - the confluence of German preparations, the tides, and the moon - seemed to point to the imminent possibility of invasion, sometime between September 8 and 10. "It seemed certain that the man was going to try," Churchill said.

(As he would later discover, both he and Virginia were indeed on the Gestapo's arrest list.) Churchill, with his much greater natural pugnacity but with equally suicidal grimness, said he planned to use the slogan, "You can always take one with you."

Ismay was apparently one of several British officials who all had the same thought at the same time. "It is essential to instill into the civilian population a thoroughly offensive spirit and a determination to attack the enemy by every means in their power, even after he may have succeeded in occupying some of our territory," Ismay had explained a couple of weeks earlier. "Action by the civilian population in subjugated areas," he suggested, had the potential "to give the enemy an immense amount of trouble."

He was tall, slim, rich, and famous for his published accounts (in the Times and in several best-selling books) of his adventures: exploring the Brazilian Amazon, trekking 3,500 miles from Peking to Kashmir. (He would later be even more identifiable as the brother of Ian Fleming, the creator of james Bond.)

In fact, its brief was to study guerrilla warfare tactics. With Fleming at MI(R) was Major Gubbins, a decorated veteran of the Great War. He was 43, and shared with Fleming a penchant for travel and being well dressed, but in most other ways was a contrast. A colleague described him as a "small wiry little Scotsman"; another as "a real Highland toughie, bloody brilliant." Pushy and tenacious, Gubbins had already produced three soon-to-be-classic training manuals for Allied partisan fighters - Partisan Leader's Handbook, The Art of Guerilla Warfare, and How to Use High Explosives.

A week later he and the rest of the British embassy staff in Warsaw were fleeing the oncoming German blitzkrieg; Gubbins eventually made his way to Romania, where he obtained a false passport, slipped out of the country, and returned to England. During the ill-fated Norway campaign, he led several British special forces units that planned to use fish ing trawlers to carry out hit-and-run attacks on German supply lines. But British forces were withdrawn before Gubbins s commandos could come into action.

Gubbins was named to command the operation. Seeking a name that would "cover a multitude of possible lines of action and wouldn't create too much suspicion," Gubbins decided to call his new secret army of British guerrillas "Auxiliary Units."

Hastily dispatched there with barely any instructions on how to proceed, Fleming decided that even before he began recruiting and training his men he had better put some stopgap preparations in place. Rounding up a supply of empty metal milk cans, he filled them with explosives, attached fuses, loaded them onto trucks along with crates of guns, bullets, and food, and drove around the countryside dropping them off with somewhat haphazardly chosen residents.

As David Lampe noted in his book The Last Ditch, while most of the officers were old-boy-network patricians of Fleming's stamp, more than a few locally notorious smugglers and poachers joined the ranks, alongside well-to-do farmers, country doctors, gamekeepers and fishing guides, masters of foxhounds, shepherds - all men extremely familiar with local geography. Many of the initial recruits for the Auxiliary Units were stripped from the ranks of the Home Guard - much to the outrage of local commanders whose best soldiers kept disappearing without explanation. But Gubbins would pave the way by calling on the senior commanders and explaining that he had the power to take any men he wanted, whether they liked it or not; would they, accordingly, identify their most able and experienced men, preferably those who had served in the First World War?

Most recruits did not even tell their families of their role until long after the war was over: for decades, the wife of one farm laborer who served in an Auxiliary Unit was convinced that her husband had been sneaking out to see another woman several nights a week during the war. But as Gubbins's officers explained to their men, their lives as well as the lives of their loved ones could very well depend on their families literally knowing nothing of their activities that could be revealed to the Germans.

The postmistress would peer at their ID cards, duck into the back to make a phone call, and return saying only, "Somebody's coming to fetch you." Then she would studiously ignore the new arrival, refusing to answer any of his questions until a car came to whisk him away.

(The poachers and smugglers had a head start here.) To practice during the daylight hours, they wore heavy dark goggles while the trainers observed them. The curriculum also included preparing and setting off charges of plastic explosives, using Thompson submachine guns and high-velocity sniper rifles, improvising booby traps (a training manual advised, "with a little imagination dozens of ideas will present themselves... the essential point is that for outdoor booby traps you must aim at killing by splinters - not by blast"), and familiarization with an array of secret sabotage weapons, including small mines disguised as lumps of horse manure that could burst the tires of a passing vehicle. Trainees were instructed on the vulnerable points of airplanes, tanks, trucks, and railroad tracks, and were expected to be able to answer hundreds of unusual exam questions:

Initial estimates in fact put the life expectancy of the Auxiliary patrols in weeks, if not days - or even 24 hours. In later years, veterans of the force matter-of-factly recounted their complete willingness to carry out their tasks with utter ruthlessness blowing up targets even if British civilians would be killed, assassinating collaborators, even killing their wounded comrades so they could not be captured and tortured for information by the Germans. "It was agreed you never left anyone behind," recalled farmer Charlie Mason. "We'd kill him and then booby trap the body. We were told all this before we signed on."

Patrols would consist of a leader and six men. They would operate with almost complete autonomy to safeguard the organization; QO patrol would even know the identity of other members, so they could not be infiltrated or betrayed (as would later occur time and again, and with devastating consequences, to the French Resistance).

So his idea was that the instant the invasion began, Auxiliary Unit members throughout the country would simply vanish: they would move into prepared hideouts provisioned ahead of time with food, water, and weapons; wait for the Germans to pass by; and then emerge each night to wreak what havoc they could on the enemy's rear.

A main room, often covered with an arch of corrugated steel, typically 20 feet long by 10 feet wide, held bunks and cases of food and explosives; a side room was fitted with a chemical toilet and cooking stove.

A rectangular trapdoor was built into a sheep-feed trough; a half-ton tree trunk was mounted on a concealed underground hinge and counterbalance that could swing aside to reveal the opening; a gardener's glass-covered cold frame, complete with growing cucumbers, covered more than one hideout entrance. In Wales and Northumberland, long-forgotten mines were pressed into service; in Scotland, dome-shaped, rock-lined underground dwellings constructed 2,000 years ago by the Picts served the purpose. By war's end, some 1,000 hideouts had been built. (While most were later destroyed, a few remnants can still be found, and were cataloged by archaeologists of the Defence of Britain Project in the late 1990s.)

But it was only after the Allies had secured the French coastlines following the D-Day invasion in June 1944 that the threat of a German landing finally receded for good. The Auxiliary Units had one more assignment before then, however: fearing that the Germans might respond to D-Day with a counterstrike against the Isle of Wight, several patrols were sent there in May 1944, prepared to open a behind-the-lines front to keep the Germans occupied while the D-Day landings proceeded.

A few members of Britain's never-to-be resistance movement joined special forces units in the regular army. But most recognized that, given their peculiar training, "we weren't even of any use as soldiers," as one Auxiliary Unit member recalled, adding that they didn't even "know how to salute." At the end of the month they all received a letter from their commander thanking them for their dedication to "a job which would require more skill and coolness, more hard work and greater danger than was demanded of any other voluntary organization" - and regretting that "in view of the fact that your lives depended on secrecy no public recognition will be possible.

Churchill himself took the keenest interest in the underground army, insisting on seeing weekly reports on its progress and making sure that first priority for new weapons went to them. But he also once observed that "wars are not won by heroic militias."

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/105/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-21Churchill was confident that as long as the Royal Air Force commanded the air and the Royal Navy the sea, an initial German landing would have faltered on attempts to land a second wave and maintain supply lines across the Channel. A war-game exercise by the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in 1974 reached the same conclusion: though the Germans would almost surely have been able to secure a significant beachhead, they would have been cut off by the Royal Navy and ultimately defeated before they could cross the main defensive line of pillboxes and antitank barriers erected to protect London.

"I have often wondered what would have happened if two hundred thousand German storm troops had actually established themselves ashore," Churchill later wrote. "The massacre on both sides would have been grim and great. There would have been neither mercy nor quarter." There is little doubt that Churchill's secret army would have played a prominent part in that grim and great massacre, and that it was more than prepared to carry out Churchill's admonition to "take one with you."

This ordinary bedroom is a case in point. Churchill would sometimes sleep here during the grimmest days of the blitz when his personal detectives managed to persuade their obstinate boss that it would be unsafe to return to No. 10 Downing Street for the night. And one of its most telling images is a chamber pot on the floor at the foot of the bed: it reminds us that although an indisputably great man, Winston Churchill was also an ordinary mortal -- particularly when the nearest washroom was three floors away.

Death penalty cases cost the taxpayer far more for defenses and appeals over a period of years. A Palm Beach Post study showed that the state would save $51 million a year by imposing life- without-parole sentences to killers, rather than death. Since 1976, 44 executions have cost Florida taxpayers an average of $24 million each.

A Palm Beach Post study showed that the state would save $51 million a year by imposing life- without-parole sentences to killers, rather than death. Since 1976, 44 executions have cost Florida taxpayers an average of $24 million each.

The director of New York University's Grey Art Gallery motioned to the exhibition of 120 photographs by Ernest Cole that surrounded us. A black South African in the era of apartheid, Cole (1940-1990) early on determined to document the brutal reality of his country's racial policies. His precocity and energy are evident in the show and, since it was illegal to photograph much of what he shot, so are his courage and cunning. Exile was the reward for his success.

To photograph this way requires that the picture be meticulously composed at the moment the shutter is released, with no superfluous elements. Given the furtive conditions under which he frequently worked, the elegance -- the sense of just-rightness -- of his images is extraordinary. Like Cartier-Bresson, Cole pushed photojournalism to art, at which point his pictures needed no text to be comprehended.

In one picture, five pensive tribesmen wait for processing and assignment; there are huge holes in the pants of the man in front. In another photo, a man whose jacket is in shreds is seen in profile having his fingerprints taken by a black employee in a natty suit, shirt and tie. In a picture similar to Dorothea Lange's classic "White Angel Breadline," light singles out one man waiting in a crowd and makes him representative of the whole. Thirteen naked men stand side-by-side facing a wall with their hands raised over their heads in a picture of a medical examination that was certainly taken surreptitiously; the rhythmic and sensuous play of light on their raised black arms, shoulders, buttocks and legs is offset by the sterile whiteness of a porcelain sink to the right of the frame.

One of his dodges was to put his camera in a paper bag and cover it with a napkin and a sandwich; the bag had a flap in front of the lens that he opened to shoot and quickly shut. On other occasions he carried his camera hidden in his jacket. And, like gunslingers in cowboy movies practicing their draw, he trained himself to bring his camera to eye level, shoot, and hide it again in a motion too fast for most people to notice. But his most audacious stratagem to gain access to forbidden areas involved hoodwinking the authorities into having him classified as Colored (mixed-race) rather than Bantu. Being caught in any of this would have meant prison, possibly torture, and conceivably death.

There was little food, and he was slight, barely growing to 5 feet, and sickly. A good student, he nonetheless dropped out of high school when the apartheid curriculum designed to keep blacks inferior was imposed. He took one correspondence course to complete his secondary education, and then, already infatuated with cameras, took another with the New York Institute of Photography. Persistence got him a job as a photojournalist on Drum, a black magazine dealing with social issues, where he made contact with photographers who recognized his talent and helped him advance. He was a neat dresser, a devout Catholic, intensely self-disciplined, private and, once he determined to bear witness, indefatigable in pursuit of images he could use.

In a picture of an empty classroom, there is litter on the floor, but no desks or chairs; the government provided none. A related picture shows boys on their knees, bent over to write on sheets of paper on the floor. In an overcrowded classroom, girls in jumpers and white blouses stand with their hands raised, each trying to get the teacher to call on her. There is a memorable portrait of a young boy crouching with a slate board on this knee, and his eyes fixed to the front; two lines of sweat trickle down his cheek, tokens of the heat in the poorly ventilated classroom and of the intensity with which he is concentrating. It is the sort of picture that, once seen, is indelible.

The women live in tiny quarters with makeshift furniture. One woman sits arm akimbo on an apple crate with a newspaper and a doily for a cushion; nearby is a cheap aluminum teapot and a chipped metal cup. Deborah Willis, a professor of photography at NYU and an authority on images of black people, accompanied me through the exhibition and noted that the woman's eyeglasses meant she was taking care of her body, and her jewelry -- bracelets, earrings, a ring -- was a sign of her self-regard, of her maintaining a sense of dignity.

The police knew Cole would have to have ingratiated himself with the gang to know when they were going to strike, and they wanted him to inform on them. Cole made arrangements to get his negatives and prints out of the country, and fled from South Africa. He was 26 and never saw his homeland again.

It had a great impact on raising awareness of apartheid and made Cole a hero to the South African expatriate communities in Europe and America.

It was during that decade that federal laws like the Kansas-Nebraska Act, and court rulings like the Dred Scott decision, escalated tensions over the issue of slavery.

Within a few weeks of his victory, South Carolina seceded from the Union. And by the time Lincoln was inaugurated on March 4, 1861, six other states had seceded and four more threatened to leave. These 11 states would eventually become the Confederacy under President Jefferson Davis. On April 12, the Confederate bombardment of Fort Sumter in Charleston, South Carolina, marked the beginning of the Civil War.

But he believed the Union couldn't survive without the loyalty of the slave-holding border states (Delaware, Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri), so he proceeded cautiously. He also felt constrained by the Constitution, which deliberately avoided using the term slavery but contained clauses that implicitly protected slavery in the states where it already existed.

It said any slaves being used to support the rebellion who came within Union lines would be emancipated. But Union soldiers in the South were forbidden to entice slaves working on farms and plantations to leave.

It authorized him to issue an order freeing slaves in Confederate territory. Sometime over the following weekend, Lincoln drafted the Emancipation Proclamation and read it to his cabinet on July 22.

The Union Army had recently suffered a humiliating setback in Virginia, where it had failed to capture the Confederate capital of Richmond. If you release an Emancipation Proclamation now, Seward told Lincoln, "it may be viewed as the last measure of an exhausted government-a cry for help." Wait, Seward urged the president, and release it after the Union achieves a clear military victory. That way emancipation will look like a sign of the Union's strength and superior moral principles.

In an open letter to the president published in The New York Tribune in August 1862, Horace Greeley, an abolitionist and the editor of the newspaper, wrote how "sorely disappointed and deeply pained" he was by Lincoln's failure to act more decisively on slavery.

It was a bloody, costly victory for the Union, but it was the win Lincoln had been waiting for. He issued a "preliminary" Emancipation Proclamation, giving the rebel states until the end of the year to lay down their arms and rejoin the Union. If they refused, he would emancipate their slaves on the first day of the new year.

The New York Times called it an act that "marks an era in the history, not only of this war, but of this country and the world. . . . Whatever may be its immediate results, it changes entirely the relations of the National Government to the institution of Slavery."

Still, it accomplished several important things:

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-22* First, it authorized the enlistment of free blacks for "armed service" in the Union Army. By the last year of the war, blacks made up about 20 percent of the Union Army, tipping the balance of military power decisively in favor of the Union.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-22* The Proclamation also lifted the ban on enticement. Union soldiers were now authorized to go onto Southern farms and plantations and entice slaves away from their owners to work for the Union, not only depriving the South of slave labor but adding strength to the Union's efforts.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-22* It also put tremendous pressure on the slave-holding border states loyal to the Union. Lincoln always believed that the best way to abolish slavery was for the states to do it themselves, with the encouragement of the federal government. When Union authorities began recruiting black soldiers from loyal states that were technically exempted from emancipation, the institution of slavery was weakened in those states as well.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-22* Most importantly, perhaps, the Proclamation gave the war an added meaning: It was no longer just about preserving the Union; it was now also about ending slavery. The Union had been concerned throughout the war that France and Britain, which relied on the South for cotton, would come to the aid of the Confederacy. But those countries were morally opposed to slavery, and therefore were much less likely to side with the Confederacy after the Proclamation was issued.

There were 4 million slaves and 15 slave states in 1860. By early 1864, Lincoln and the Republicans realized that to permanently end slavery, they would have to amend the Constitution. The 13th Amendment was narrowly passed by Congress in January 1865 and ratified in December- eight months after the end of the Civil War and Lincoln's assassination.

After the Civil War, during the era of Reconstruction (1865-1877), Congress passed the 14th and 15th amendments (see Timeline), which recognized blacks, including former slaves, as U.S. citizens and granted black men the right to vote. For a time, blacks achieved a measure of political power in the South, and were elected to the House and Senate from a number of states.

White lawmakers in the South later amended their state constitutions and pushed through local "Jim Crow" laws to severely narrow the scope of black citizenship. The laws also enforced strict racial segregation in schools and other public places, and by the early 20th century had effectively destroyed black voting in much qf the South.

After World War II, the civil rights movement began to gather steam.

Some historians see him as a reluctant emancipator, a president who for a long time was unwilling to transform a war for the Union into a war to abolish slavery. Others think of Lincoln as a political genius who was biding his time until public opinion caught up to his views. There are those, too, who find both explanations inadequate, seeing them as failing to capture the complex nature of who Lincoln was as a politician and a man.

A steadily growing population that encompasses 124 nationalities and severely restricted territory has made land reclamation the only viable solution. But while extending into the sea has helped enlarge the principality by 20 per cent over recent years, it's very expensive, and a major new phase had to be shelved in 2009 because of uncertainties in the global economy.

That is an everyday challenge," he says. Given Monaco's reliance on tourism and property, the principality has suffered a slowdown of its own, although Albert says there have been signs of improvement since the beginning of the year.

Crime, for example, is virtually non-existent. Several Monegasques told me it was the safest place in the world, with a policeman for every 70 people. An eastern European gang was using the principality as a base a few years ago, but the network was broken up and some of its members arrested.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/107/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-22"It comes down to the fact that in a different age, radio drove everything," said Seth Friedman, an artist manager with DAS Communications, who represents John Legend, Will.i.am, the Black Eyed Peas and other artists who have worked with the coffee chain on entertainment deals. "Today [radio is] less and less of a factor, and without radio as a promo driver, artists have a more difficult time reaching their audience. These days more people are going to Starbucks than a record store."

Tower Records' brick-and-mortar stores are but one casualty of digital downloads, which are also a problem for artists because they more often distribute singles and artists create albums. CD sales fell 20% to 89 million copies during this year's first quarter, according to SoundScan, while individual tracks purchased online grew 10% to 288 million.

(Hear Music hopes to release two other albums this year and eight in 2008.) Mr. McCartney's relationship with EMI Group's Capitol Records has recently been on an album-by-album basis, according to knowledgeable executives. He is said to be continuing work on a classical album under the Capitol label.

His last album to break the million mark in the U.S. was 2001's "Wingspan." Compare that with the 23 million combined unit sales of albums from the top six "American Idol" artists, and Sir Paul needs more than a little luck to reach the masses these days.

"The great thing to see was the commitment, the passion and the love of music. It's good to see."

In recent years, retailers have struck exclusive distribution deals to help drive traffic to their stores. Some observers speculate the albums are loss leaders designed to draw potential sales for appliances or similar big-ticket items. Last month, Target Corp. said it would release 15 exclusive CDs through the 180 Music label called the Spotlight Music Series, first by Kenny Loggins and David Cassidy, to be followed by others. Wal-Mart Stores struck exclusive deals with Garth Brooks and the Eagles.

Mr. McCartney's move illustrates how even famed artists are struggling to find the right way to distribute music, according to Gary Bongiovamu, editor in chief of Pollstar, which tracks concert-ticket sales.

Although his athletic career ended more than 20 years ago, Muhammad Ali, three-time World Heavyweight Boxing champion, continues to be known and revered by young and old alike. From his modest beginnings in Louisville, Kentucky, to his selection as Athlete of the Century, Muhammad Ali is remembered for his incredible skill as a boxer, as well as his stance against the draft, his efforts for civil rights and justice, and his work against world poverty. Easily understood text and lots of colorful photos capture the talented young boxer, his commitment to Islam, and his battle with Parkinson's disease. A glossary is appended. A well-handled, accessible biography, in the Dorling Kindersley Readers series, for young readers. -Karen Hutt

The judge said police also violated a state law requiring that interrogations of those who are in custody be recorded.

District Attorney Carrie Schneider conceded that Jackson's rights were violated, but said the error occurred later in the night.

"There's no doubt in my mind -- especially after watching the video and observing Ms. Jackson in obvious pain and discomfort -- that not only did Ms. Jackson feel she was not free to go, but a reasonable person would feel they would not be free."

Depending on the the length and purpose of the interrogation and the degree of restraint, custody is defined as a reasonable person considering herself not free to leave.

Officers who testified said it was a complex issue and refused to acknowledge potential violations of Jackson's rights.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/103/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-23Let's begin with the things you already know about concrete: Concrete is, of course, strong - at least in compression. And concrete reinforced with steel can handle the worst abuse - we build bomb shelters and prisons with concrete. It doesn't rot, even under water or in soil. It can be molded into nearly any shape imaginable. (Think Calatrava's Tenerife Auditorium.}

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/103/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-23You may also know that concrete's thermal mass can contribute to a building's energy efficiency by reducing interior temperature swings, thereby reducing the size of heating and cooling equipment. It can incorporate recycled material like fly ash and blast furnace slag. And, it's mold-proof and does not off-gas toxic substances.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/103/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-23On the other hand, you also know that concrete requires formwork that can be expensive, increasing the initial cost of construction. Concrete is more complicated to build with and once in place is difficult to change. Poorly built concrete surfaces are not very attractive and cracking seems inevitable. And it just isn't warm and inviting like wood.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/103/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-23Concrete's greatest contribution to sustainability lies in is its durability. When a concrete building is designed properly, it will perform admirably for many years and will offer its residents energy efficiency and safe shelter from nearly any natural or manmade disaster. And when the end of its life finally does arrive, concrete is eminently recyclable and can even be turned into new concrete by crushing it into aggregate.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/103/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-23But aren't concrete structures more expensive? The same question is often asked about sustainable construction in general and that, of course, depends on how you measure it. The initial cost for concrete buildings is typically a bit higher than for buildings using other materials. But we all know that is only a small part of the story The true way to look at the cost of a building is through life cycle assessment, including everything from extracting the raw materials (and reclamation of mine sites) through operating and maintenance expenses until the end of the building's life. This is where concrete shines, since operating expenses are typically much less for a concrete structure. Consider the Roman Pantheon's concrete dome, which is still standing after 2000 years.

Energy-efficient, safe concrete homes come in a wide variety of configurations. "The initial cost of a concrete home depends on several variables," said the PCA's Jim Niehoff, "especially the experience of the builder with the particular system and part of the country you are building in. In a costal area, for example, you have heightened requirements to meet certain wind loads. You really have to beef up wood frame construction to meet those standards, but you don't have to do much different with a concrete home. So all of a sudden, concrete is very competitive."

For five years in a row, including the home now under construction for the 2008 show in January concrete has been a primary component of The New American Home. (TNAH) "The 2009 home hasn't been finalized yet," said the Portland Cement Association's residential promotion manager, Jim Niehoff, "but we're hoping to make it six in a row There's a nice synergy since they always want to demonstrate cutting edge housing technology and each year that includes concrete."

By combining air-tightness and thermal mass, the above-grade walis provide thermal performance equivalent to an R-26 wall. Foundation walls are also precast panels, with exterior R-5 insulation. The cement-based stucco used on much of the home's exterior incorporates a new photocatalytic cement, TX Active, from Italcementi. Developed initially as a self-cleaning cement, it was soon learned the reaction also consumes carbon monoxide, nitrous oxides, and sulfur dioxide. Italcementi has calculated that coating 15 percent of the exterior wall surfaces in Milan with TX Active would result in a 50 percent reduction in airborne pollutants.

While safer buildings may be good for the insurance industry, they are much better for the people who live in them. The Institute for Business & Home Safety (www.ibhs.org) has developed a program called "Fortified... for Safer Living" to develop guidelines that will minimize the property damage homeowners suffer from natural disasters. Fortified program manager Chuck Vanee says, "the program is code-plus with independent verification inspection. Any home that meets the Fortified standards will be above the minimum standards if code is in place and quite a bit above local practice in areas where code is not in place."

"Every Fortified home must have independent verification by an IBHS-certified inspector that it meets a specific requirement for a given location, which is code-plus, even if they already have a code in place," said Vanee. "We believe these homes will stand up even better than code-designed and built homes. For the homeowner, this means peace of mind and a stronger, safer, more durable home that is more sustainable in the face of the perils in their region."

So, it's a little easier to get to a Fortified home using concrete. Those builders that are using concrete residential building techniques tend to be building a stronger better home already and they know it and want to get credit for it."

It then looks at the extent to which Miranda applies to undercover police interrogation and whether Miranda warnings are required prior to routine booking questions. Next, the article comments on the development of the so-called "public safety" exception and whether police may continue to interrogate a suspect after he makes an equivocal request for a lawyer. Finally, it examines a statutory substitute for Miranda that has yet to receive constitutional review by the Supreme Court.

A male suspect robbed the woman of $8 at knife-point after forcing his way into her car.(2) Four months later, the same suspect abducted an 18-year-old girl at knife-point and, after tying her hands and feet, drove to a secluded area of the desert and raped her.(3)

Miranda had a prior arrest record for armed robbery and a juvenile record for, among other things, attempted rape, assault, and burglary. Both victims viewed corporeal lineups and identified Miranda as their attacker. The police questioned Miranda, and he confessed to both crimes. He signed a confession to the rape that included a typed paragraph explaining that the statement was made voluntarily without threats or promises of immunity and that he had full knowledge of his rights and understood that the statement could be used against him.(4)

The Court ruled that "an individual held for interrogation must be clearly informed that he has the right to consult with a lawyer and have the lawyer with him during interrogation...[that he has] the right to remain silent and that anything stated can be used in evidence against him...that if he is indigent a lawyer will be appointed to represent him."(5) The Court reasoned that all custodial police interrogations are inherently coercive and could never result in a voluntary statement in the absence of a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver of the rights enumerated in the Miranda warnings.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-23The Miranda decision was a departure from the established law in the area of police interrogation. Prior to Miranda, a confession would be suppressed only if a court determined it resulted from some actual coercion, threat, or promise. Under Miranda, the Supreme Court established an irrebuttable presumption that a statement is involuntary if it is taken during custodial interrogation without a waiver of the so-called Miranda warnings.(6) A statement taken in violation of Miranda would result in the suppression of the statement, even though the statement was otherwise voluntary and not the result of coercion of any kind. In fact, in the Miranda decision, the Supreme Court acknowledged that Ernesto Miranda was not subjected to any coercion that would render his statement involuntary in traditional terms.(7)

For purposes of Miranda, "custody" is defined as an arrest or significant deprivation of freedom equivalent to an arrest.(8) "Interrogation," under Miranda, is defined as words or actions likely to elicit an incriminating response from an average suspect.(9)

Five years after Miranda, the Supreme Court decided Harris v. New York.(12) With only two of the five justices in the original Miranda majority still on the Court, the Supreme Court held that a statement taken in violation of Miranda could be used to impeach the credibility of a defendant at trial.

The prosecution did not use the statement during the case in chief. However, when the defendant took the stand, he contradicted his postarrest statement.

Interestingly, the Court observed that the defendant made "no claim that the statements made to the police were coerced or involuntary."(13) This statement by the Supreme Court was a signal that the Court was prepared to abandon the position that statements made by a suspect during custodial interrogation are presumptively involuntary. That presumption was the reason given for requiring Miranda warnings in the first place.

Haas,(14) the Supreme Court followed the precedent in Harris and ruled that a defendant's statement may be used to impeach the defendant, even if that statement was taken after the defendent requested an attorney during the custodial interrogation. The Haas Court distinguished the Miranda presumption of involuntariness from actual involuntariness and stated that if, "...in a given case, the officers conduct amounts to abuse, that case, like those involving coercion or duress, may be taken care of when it arises measured by the traditional standards for evaluating voluntariness and trustworthiness."(15) A statement that is in fact involuntary is inadmissible for any purpose including impeachment.(16)

However, if the defendants in Doyle had not been told by police that they had a right to remain silent, there would have been no due process violation if their silence was subsequently used to impeach their credibility. Under those circumstances, their silence would not have been induced by the implicit promise in the Miranda warnings that their silence would not be used against them.(19)

In Elstad, the police arrested the defendant, Michael Elstad, for burglary. When one of the officers sat down with Elstad to explain that he thought Elstad was involved in the burglary, Elstad responded by saying, "Yes, I was there."(25) The police did not advise Elstad of his Miranda warnings until after he had been transported to the sheriff's department, 1 hour later. He then waived his Miranda rights and confessed to the burglary.

Four justices argued that an exception should be carved out when routine booking questions are asked, because booking questions are not ordinarily intended to elicit information for investigative purposes. The other four justices believed that it was not necessary to determine if the slurred responses fell within a routine booking questions exception to Miranda. They considered the Miranda rule as a formula to protect a person's Fifth Amendment right against compelled self-incrimination, which involves testimonial evidence. The responses to the booking questions were incriminating not because of the testimonial substance of what the defendant said, but because the slurred speech was nontestimonial evidence of intoxication.

Consequently, a violation of the Miranda ruling does not necessarily mean that the resulting statement will be inadmissible. The Supreme Court has made it clear that the Miranda warnings are not constitutionally required but are only prophylactic rules designed to protect a suspect's right against compelled self-incrimination. Voluntariness remains the constitutional standard that must be met when obtaining a statement from a suspect.

One should be mindful, however, of Sixth Amendment restrictions placed on undercover police interrogations. The Sixth Amendment right to counsel attaches at the inception of adversarial judicial proceedings and at every subsequent critical stage of the prosecution, including when being interrogated by the police or appearing at a corporeal lineup. See Massiah v. United States, 377 U.S. 201 (1964) and United States v. Wade, 388 U.S. 218 (1967). The Sixth Amendment right to counsel only attaches to those specific formal charges brought against the defendant. McNeil v. Wisconsin, 501 U.S. 171 (1991). Police cannot deliberately elicit an incriminating response from a suspect after attachment of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel without first obtaining a waiver. Miranda type warnings are sufficient to obtain a waiver of a suspects' right to counsel. Patterson v. Illinois, 487 U.S. 285 (1988). If a suspect has invoked his right to counsel, an officer may not reinitiate contact with the suspect regarding the specific charges for which formal judicial proceedings have begun. Michigan v. Jackson, 475 U.S. 625 (1986). However, a valid waiver may be obtained if the defendant initiates communications with the officer. Officers may not use informants to deliberately elicit an incriminating statement after the 6th Amendment right to counsel has attached. United States v. Henry, 447 U.S. 264 (1980). An informant, however, may be used as a mere listening post. In addition, Department of Justice (DOJ) regulations govern the circumstances under which DOJ attorneys may communicate directly or indirectly with persons known to be represented by counsel in the course of law enforcement investigations and proceedings. 28 C. F. R. [sections]3377.1-77.2.

While statements that are suppressed due to a violation of Miranda are the clearest examples of the cost of the Miranda ruling, Miranda warnings themselves tend to deter a suspect from giving a statement. Professor Paul G. Cassell, in his article Miranda's Social Costs: An Empirical Reassessment, 90 NORTHWESTERN L. J. 387 (1996), examined numerous studies that analyzed the deterrent effect of Miranda warnings. He set forth convincing evidence which established that compliance with Miranda has had a severe impact on the effectiveness of law enforcement. Professor Cassell's research revealed that approximately 79,000 property crimes, 42,000 drag cases, 6,500 robbery cases, 1,400 forcible rape cases, and 880 murder and non-negligent homicide cases went unprosecuted in 1993 alone due to suspects being deterred from making a statement after being given their Miranda warnings.

Professor Cassell reviewed a 1994 study that indicated that 30.6% of suspects successfully questioned pied to the charged offense, whereas only 15.4% of suspects who invoked their Miranda rights pled to the charged offense. In addition, he discovered that Miranda has a more significant effect on the most serious offenses. For example, one study cited by Professor Cassell revealed that, while the overall confession rate dropped 16.9% after the Miranda ruling, the confession rate dropped 27.3% in homicide cases and dropped 25.7% in robbery cases. It should be noted that the police department in that study did in fact give Miranda equivalent warnings prior to the Miranda decision, but weaved them into the conversation rather than giving them at the outset of the interrogation. Apparently, requiring a waiver prior to the onset of interrogation has a material impact on the effectiveness of police questioning.

In United States v. Crocker, 510 F.2d 1129 (10th Cir. 1975), the court ruled that [section]3501, is in fact, constitutional and approved of the trial court applying the statute instead of Miranda in deciding to admit into evidence the defendant's confession. Other courts have refused to apply [section]3501 when the government has raised the issue. E.g., Ailsworth v. United States, 448 F.2d 439, 441 (9th Cir. 1971) (The court expressly declined to decide whether [section] 3501 was applicable. The court, instead, decided that the Miranda violation in that case was not reversible error.); United States v. Vigo, 487 F.2d 295,299 (2d Cir. 1973) (The court found that the defendant's statement was voluntary under the Fifth Amendment and in compliance with Miranda, despite the fact that the federal agent neglected to inform the defendant that anything he said could be used against him. The court found that it was unnecessary to reach the question of the applicability of [section]3501 and refused to apply the statute.). In Davis v. United States, the Supreme Court quoted from United States v. Alverez-Sanchez, 511 U.S. 350, 114 S. Ct. 1599, 1600 (1994) where the Alverez-Sanchez Court stated that 18 U.S.C. [section]3501 is "the statute governing the admissibility of confessions in federal prosecutions." 114 S. Ct. at 2354 n *. However, the quote in Davis is merely dicta because the Alverez-Sanchez Court was not deciding whether to apply [3501] in lieu of Miranda, and the Davis Court refused to address the issue of the applicability of [section]3501.

See The Department of Justice Office of Legal Policy, Report to the Attorney General on the Law of Pretrial Interrogation (February 12, 1986), wherein the former DOJ Office of Legal Policy examined the history of pretrial interrogation and the Miranda decision. The Office of Legal Policy viewed 18 U.S.C. [section]3501 as overturning the Miranda decision and restoring the pre-Miranda voluntariness standard. The report advocated asserting [section]3501 as a direct challenge to Miranda, but the Department of Justice has not yet taken a position on that recommendation.

She was arrested while riding a city bus in Montgomery, Alabama. The charge: Refusing to give up her seat to a white man. Her defiance helped spark the civil rights movement, when AfricanAmericans and others worked to gain equal rights.

She was sitting in the fifth row, with three other black passengers. After a few stops, the first four rows filled up, and a white man was left standing. The driver ordered Parks and the other riders in her row to give up their seats. The others obeyed, but Parks refused to move. The driver called the police, who took her away in a squad car.

At that time, many states and cities in the South had laws requiring segregation - the separation of people based on race. In many places, black people weren't allowed to attend the same schools or eat at the same restaurants as white people. On buses, they couldn't sit in the same section as whites.

They argued that segregation on buses violated the Constitution. The case went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. On November 13, 1956, the Court banned segregation on public buses. African-Americans were free to sit wherever they wanted. The Montgomery bus boycott finally ended after 381 days.

In a study out  today in the journal Science, researchers say that the middle depths of a part of the Pacific Ocean have warmed 15 times faster in the past 60 years than they did during the previous 10,000 years. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-23 Most of the heat that humanity has put into the atmosphere since the 1970s from greenhouse gas emissions has likely been absorbed by the oceans, according to the most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a United Nations- sponsored group of scientists that issues reports every few years about the effects of global warming.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-23 "We're pumping heat into the ocean at a faster rate over the past 60 years," said study lead author Yair Rosenthal, a climate scientist at Rutgers University. "We may have underestimated the efficiency of the oceans as a storehouse for heat and energy," he added. "It may buy us some time -- how much time, I don't really know. But it's not going to stop climate change." 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-23 "It's not so much the magnitude of the change, but the rate of change," noted study co-author Braddock Linsley, a Columbia University climate scientist. "We're experimenting by putting all this heat in the ocean without quite knowing how it's going to come back out and affect climate." 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-23 He said that in the past six decades the temperature of the Pacific Ocean water studied (from the surface to about 2,200 feet below) has increased by about one-third of a degree Fahrenheit. (The specific area studied was in the Pacific near Indonesia, chosen because that's a typical sample of Pacific Ocean water.) Researchers say that while the amount of warming might seem small in the scheme of things, it's the rate of warming that's so alarming, Linsley said. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-23 The researchers found that Pacific Ocean water has generally been cooling over the past 10,000 years, until about 800 years ago, when temperatures started to slowly rise. (Then fell again, during the so- called Little Ice Age from the mid-1500s to mid-1800s). It's been only in the past few decades, though, that the rate has dramatically increased. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-23 The Earth's atmosphere has been about the same temperature for the past 15 years or so, providing fuel for skeptics of man-made global warming. However, this study, along with other recent research, finds  that heat absorbed by the planet's oceans has increased significantly. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-23 Obviously, there were no thermometers taking measurements of ocean temperatures over the past few thousand years (instrument records from buoys go back only to the 1960s). So scientists had to use "proxy" sources to measure temperature. In this case, it was fossils of ancient marine life -- little shelled animals known as foraminifera -- that could be analyzed to reconstruct the climates in which they lived over millennia. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-23 "This is a relatively new way of measuring past temperature data," Rosenthal noted.

It may be up to natural variability in the Pacific: When the La Nioa climate pattern (cooler than average Pacific Ocean water) switches, and the Pacific reverts to a warmer-than-usual El Nioo phase, global temperatures may likely shoot up again, along with the rate of warming, said Kevin Trenberth, a climate scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., who was not involved in the research.

That's according to a report released by Oxfam today, which urges G20 leaders to tackle gender inequality when they meet in Australia later this year.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/107/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-23The report, G20 and gender equality - How the G20 can advance women's rights in employment, social protection and fiscal policies, shows how the G20's growth ambitions cannot be realised without policies addressing systemic discrimination and economic exclusion of women across G20 countries.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/107/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-23The report, developed in collaboration with the Heinrich Boll Foundation, which assesses G20 countries across a number of gender-related policies, is being released as the Business 20 (B20) - one of the satellite conferences in the lead-up to the G20 Leaders Summit in Brisbane in November - meets in Sydney this week.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/107/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-23Oxfam's Executive Director Winnie Byanyima said that across G20 countries and beyond, women were paid less than men, did most of the unpaid labor, were over-represented in part-time work and were discriminated against in the household, markets and institutions.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/107/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-23"This gap between women and men reflects a fundamental and entrenched form of inequality afflicting G20 countries, despite the gains that have undoubtedly been made in some areas," Byanyima said.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/107/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-23Depending on the country context, an extra 20 - 60 per cent would be added to the GDP of individual G20 countries if the hidden contribution of unpaid work - such as caring for children or carrying out housework - was recognised and valued.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/107/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-23Byanyima commented: "Meanwhile, if women's paid employment rates were the same as men's, the USA's GDP would increase by nine per cent, the Eurozone's by 13 per cent and Japan's by 16 per cent."

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/107/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-23She said the absence of women's rights drove poverty, while their fulfilment could drive development.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/107/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-23"The G20's growth and development can only be considered inclusive - and can only make a positive difference to people - when women and men have equal opportunities to benefit, human rights are fulfilled and sustainable development is pursued," Byanyima said. "These are not 'women's issues' alone - they are systemic issues that determine the wellbeing of everyone, in rich and poor countries alike."

This conclusion has been hotly debated by social scientists, especially in the United States where most research on this subject emanates. As Cherlin (1999) argues, researchers have taken extreme positions, with some (e.g., Wallerstein & Blakeslee, 1989) claiming devastating effects of marital disruption, especially divorce, on children, while others (e.g., Harris, 1998) stating that the presence of parents is inconsequential for children's personality and behavior. Wallerstein and her colleagues conclude that the negative effects of divorce are not only lasting but also tend to worsen as children grow into adolescents. However, as these latter groups of studies are based on clinical and unrepresentative samples of troubled families, their claims are overstated (Cherlin, 1999). Harris, on the other extreme, asserts that growing up with only one parent does not exert any harmful effects on children and that parenting style and socioeconomic status are of little consequence for children's development. She argues that children of divorce are worse off primarily because of genetic inheritance and peer influence.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-23 Cotton farmers don't have enough information about how specific varieties perform under various levels of water availability-either from rainfall or irrigation-according to a private researcher and consultant. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-23 "We ought to know how much water it will take to make one bale of cotton with a specific variety and how much and when to apply it and how much moisture we have in the profile. We don't always know that," says Bob Glodt, president of Agri-Search in Plainview, Texas. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-23 He's testing varieties for Deltapine on his 140-acre research farm to identify how those varieties respond to certain water regimes-from rainfall only to applying 90 percent of evapotranspiration (ET) replacement. He also works with other companies on various research products and counts Bayer CropScience, Americot, FMC, BASF, and DuPont among his clients. He also consults with eight farmers. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-23 "I am reluctant to appear to be a spokesman for any company," Glodt said, but he's convinced the irrigation/variety study is needed across cotton country. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-23 "This research involves responsible, sound water management, and I am glad to be a part of it." He works with Doug Jost from Monsanto who says the goal from his perspective is to identify varieties that perform well under a wide range of climate conditions, from limited rainfall to meeting near full moisture demand.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-23 He bought the research farm in 2006. "Monsanto asked then if I would be willing to do water efficiency trials. I've been involved in the study since then." 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-23 Each year Glodt sets up tests for eight to 12 varieties, replicated four times and under four different irrigation treatments- no irrigation, 30 percent, 60 percent and 90 percent ET replacement. "That covers just about every irrigation regime possible in this area." 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-23 Trials included 194 plots and 12 varieties this year.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-23 He modified a center pivot irrigation system to apply a certain amount of water per application on 16 rows, a different amount on the next 16 rows and a different amount on the other 16 rows. He plants all plots at the same time, manages them the same and waters them at the same time "to see how varieties will respond. At the end of the year, we know. The data is applicable to cotton over a wide range." 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-23 Yields are the benchmarks. "We want to determine how much 1 inch of water or 2 inches of water buys in yield," Glodt says. Some varieties, he's found, do not take advantage of increased irrigation. "That was an eye-opener. When we irrigate, that comes out of our back pocket as opposed to free irrigation, rainfall. Not all varieties are created equal in response to increased water. And not all varieties respond the same to lower water regimes." 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-23 The point is, Glodt said, farmers need to know which varieties will take advantage of extra water and which will perform adequately, or at least better, when rainfall or irrigation capacity is limited. "This is powerful information. Over the years we have developed a lot of variety data, and I wonder why we haven't done this kind of research before." 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-23 Jost has some ideas. When cotton farmers began to get comfortable with new technology-herbicide tolerant and insect resistant varieties-weed competition and insect damage became less limiting factors. Also, water availability began to become a more crucial issue, made even more so by several years of drought.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-23 Glodt is aware of a growing need in the Texas High Plains to conserve water. He's an agronomic advisor to the Texas Alliance for Water Conservation , an organization that seeks ways to improve on- farm (and other) water management. "TAWC tries to educate farmers on new irrigation technology and irrigation management approaches while conserving irrigation resources," he says. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-23 He applies a lot of what he learns from research trials to his farm clients. "Every company should be doing this kind of work," he says. "If a farmer plants a 90 percent ET variety in a 30 percent ET regime, he may not be happy with the yields he achieves at the end of the year." 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-23 Trials have helped establish a standard. "Before these tests I couldn't estimate yield potential for 30 percent or 60 percent ET replacement. Now, I'm better able to do that." 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-23 He said test results will show farmers which varieties are more likely to perform well on dryland acres and which will respond to increased irrigation water. He wants to know how many inches of water he needs to apply to produce two and three-fourths to three bales of cotton. "At 60 percent ET replacement, two and-a-half to three bales should be possible. Some years, with 90 percent ET replacement (including rainfall) we should hit four bales." 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-23 One of four years might see 90 percent ET replacement and four- bale potential, he added. "In the other three years we might get by with 60 percent ET or a little better but with possible quality loss." 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-23 He does not advocate irrigating at 90 percent ET. "Save the water and irrigate based on potential ET and look at the cotton water demand curve to determine application timing."

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-23 He says most farmers do not have the irrigation resources to over- irrigate the crops they grow; however, better yields can be achieved when irrigation is applied at a specific percentage of potential evapotranspiration (PET). If a grower has the capacity to irrigate at 30 percent ET replacement, this amount of water should be applied to coincide with crop water demand. Then start connecting the amount of water applied to potential yield of the variety." 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-23 Jost says the trials always include several check varieties as measuring sticks for newer lines. "We've used 1044 as a standard check because it does well with limited water. We have been able to beat 1044 consistently with some new varieties, so we're making progress." 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-23 "I was skeptical when we first started," Glodt says. He's now convinced that cotton farmers need to look at several factors to determine when and how much to irrigate. Variety selection will be one of those. He also advises growers to use TAWC PET data (www.tawcsolutions.org) and Texas Tech Mesonet data to determine moisture demand. "That is critical. Even farmers who have water have to manage it right. The big dividend comes when we learn a little about water management."

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-23Petri has been pushing legislation that would provide an alternative to the current arrangement, under which federal student loans are granted based on financial need but repaid at a fixed monthly rate, regardless of a borrower's income. Under his bill, after borrowers hit an income level sufficient to cover their basic needs, 10 percent of their discretionary income would automatically be deducted from their paychecks to pay back student loans. (The deductions would not be mandatory; those who wanted to could still opt for a more traditional repayment plan.) In addition, last month Petri and Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., proposed separate legislation that would allow students to forgo the loan system altogether by promising a percentage of their future earnings to private investors who agree to pay their tuition.

What's more, collection agencies are pocketing an additional $1 billion annually in late-payment fees from borrowers, according to Sen. Tom Harkin, the chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee.

"I don't think there was any particular reason why they didn't do that at the beginning except that, initially, the loans were much smaller, the cost of education was much lower. It just wasn't something worth fooling with if you were getting a $500 student loan."

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-23Now, however, the numbers look a little bit different: Almost 39 million people in the United States owe money from student loans. The average balance is $26,000, but the collective balance of that debt tops $1 trillion, and it grew by $114 billion just last year. And the increase in the number of borrowers over the past 10 years has been steep--up from 23 million in 2005--tracking the overall growth in college enrollment, which grew 32 percent between 2001 and 2011, according to the Education Department.

"Making college more affordable" and "helping borrowers struggling with student debt" are Harkin's top priorities for the higher-education legislation he is starting to put together, according to an aide to the Iowa Democrat.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-23That higher-education bill will likely be finished next year, and automatically deducting a percentage of a borrower's income from his or her paycheck is by far the most ambitious idea being considered for inclusion in it, but the move could virtually eliminate student-loan defaults. The United Kingdom, which collects student-loan payments through paycheck withholding, sees almost no defaults from borrowers who remain in the U.K. after college. (The British government does have trouble collecting from student borrowers who become employed outside its borders, but the United States faces that situation far less often.)

For example, if the federal government could "simplify the various ways--I think there are eight of them--to help borrowers pay back their student loans," the default rate would go down, says Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., the ranking member on the HELP Committee. Senate Democrats are also planning a floor vote in June on legislation, sponsored by Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., that would allow borrowers to refinance their loans at the new, lower rates set by last year's student-loan law.

But it will help underscore a point that most seem able to agree upon: The current student-loan system is one only a collection agency could love.Â

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/107/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-24MORE THAN 10 YEARS AGO, I PARTICIPATED IN A WORKSHOP ON INTEGRATING the brain. Integrating the brain involves doing activities that engage the left and right hemispheres of the brain, which enhances comprehension and retention. The presenters touted the benefits of playing classical music in class, and I dutifully ran out and bought an assortment of Bach, Beethoven and Vivaldi to incorporate in my lessons. I was thrilled to have an excuse to play any kind of music in my classroom.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/107/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-24Most of the students appreciated the addition of music during testing or lab periods, and they could even identify some of the classical pieces, but I couldn't help feeling there was more to know about learning and music-all kinds of music. I added a CD of the London Symphony Orchestra playing songs from Pink Floyd, and I couldn't help but giggle when strains of "We don't need no education" would play to my unsuspecting students. One day, I was working with my students in the lab. Someone (maybe me) randomly started singing the Gilligan's Island theme song. Pretty soon, everyone joined in. Then someone started the theme song from The Addams Family and then Saved by the Bell. We sang TV theme songs all period. The mood was excellent and the students worked hard on their projects while they sang. We also laughed and bonded.

As part of the commemoration, the Smithsonian is opening a special exhibition in which the Wright Flyer, the brothers' pioneering airplane, will be displayed at eye level at the National Air and Space Museum, allowing the interested public to take a close look. On December 17th, exactly 100 years after the fact, at least one of several replicas of the Wright Flyer will attempt a repeat performance over the dunes near Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, with some 25,000 spectators expected to be in attendance. Those organizing various aspects of the national celebration have, of course, had to grapple with a century-old question, one of particular importance at this great moment of national pride: Were the Wright brothers really the first human beings to fly?

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-24The short answer, of course, is no. That honor goes to Jean-Francois Pilatre de Rozier and (perhaps) the Marquis d'Arlandes, who were lifted by hot-air balloon in 1783. Is the real question, then, whether the Wrights were the first to fly a heavier-than-air craft? Not exactly. Before the Wrights took off in the Flyer, they had gained experience with unpowered gliders, following the example of other pioneering aviators. That is, piloted, heavier-than-air craft were around before the Wrights, some very much resembling the hang gliders now used for recreation. So the question is whether the Wrights were the first to fly a powered, heavier-than-air vehicle-or is it?

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-24A quick investigation into the history of flight reveals numerous reports of piloted, powered flight in heavier-than-air vehicles before the Wright brothers' success. A German immigrant to the United States named Gustave Whitehead (Weisskopf), for example, is said by some to have flown in a home-built, propeller-powered contraption years before the Wrights did. Whitehead's claims are dubious for various reasons, and most aviation historians simply discount them and others of similar ilk. But some of the pre-Wright activity is hard to dismiss as pure invention.

After working under another pioneering aviator, Octave Chanute, with whom he had carried out a number of successful gliding experiments, Herring found independent backing and constructed a biplane hang glider of sorts in 1898, which included a small compressed-air engine. Herring first flew this powered, heavier-than-air craft 50 feet on October 10, 1898, over the lakeside dunes of St. Joseph, Michigan. On October 22, he managed a 73-foot flight, which a newspaper reporter witnessed and described:

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-24During the flight, which lasted eight to ten seconds, Herring's feet seemed to . . . almost graze the ground, which the machine skimmed along on a level path above the beach. The landing was characterized by a slight turning to the left and slowing of the engine when the machine came gently to rest on the sand.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-24(Tom D. Crouch, senior curator of aeronautics at the National Air and Space Museum, provided this excerpt from the 1898 newspaper account in his book A Dream of Wings.) Why then is not Herring regarded as first to achieve powered, heavier-than-air flight? Crouch offers one answer: He writes, "Herring's 1898 motorized machine rep- resented nothing more than the culmination of the hang-gliding tradition. Having made his brief powered hops, he found himself at a technological dead end." Of course, the pilots of today's powered hang gliders might have a different perspective. They could reasonably argue that plenty of people are still flying in just this manner, shifting their weight to control their craft, just as Herring and other aviation pioneers had done during the late 19th century, whereas the Wrights operated their Flyer using wing-warping controls rigged to their hips-an awkward scheme no longer found anywhere.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-24Wright supporters would counter that hip-controlled wing warping inspired more-modern systems of flight control. In any case, one can reasonably ask whether the test of lasting technological merit is fair: Flight is flight, after all. So shouldn't the nation have celebrated the true centennial of flight in 1998?

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-24Further probing into the early history of aviation quickly reveals another possibility: The world should have celebrated in 1990. A hundred years before, a Frenchman named Clement Ader flew a batlike, steam-powered contraption, which he dubbed Eole. Even the U.S. Centennial of Flight Commission (a body created by Congress to commemorate "the centennial of powered flight and the achievements of the Wright brothers' first flight") acknowledges this early accomplishment. Describing Ader's feat on their Web site, under the heading "Efforts at Powered Flight During the Last Decade Before the Wright Brothers," the commissioners state:

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-24Ader tested the Eole on October 9, 1890, over a 656.2-foot (200 meter) prepared surface at the Chateau d'Armainvilliers in Brie, southwest of Paris. Witnesses saw it "hop" about 165 feet (50 meters) as it rose a few inches off the ground, becoming the first manned, steam-powered craft to rise from level ground.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-24Again, one might reasonably wonder why a flight must be sustained or achieve control to count for a "first."

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-24Part of the explanation for the Wrights' special place in history is that they went on to improve their airplanes, making them ever more capable, whereas Ader's later craft were failures. Another part is that the American brothers were vigilant to contest rival claims, which would have weakened their position in patent litigation. In particular, they worked hard to refute the early stance of many at the Smithsonian that Samuel Pierpont Langley-a former head of that institution-deserved comparable credit for having previously built a craft capable of powered flight with someone on board. (Having successfully flown various unpiloted craft of this type, Langley made a failed attempt to fly a manned version just days before the Wrights' famous success. A later incarnation of Langley's airplane was flown successfully.) The Wrights' rivalry with Langley explains why, until 1948, the Wright Flyer remained, not at the Smithsonian, but at the Science Museum of London: Orville figured that sending the Flyer to London would make Americans question why it wasn't being displayed in Washington, and he hoped that this would keep pressure on the Smithsonian to accord him and his brother full credit.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-24Orville's plan worked, but success came only after his death (in January 1948). The contract governing the transfer of the Flyer to Washington required (according to Crouch) that "if the Smithsonian recognized any other aircraft as having been capable of powered, sustained, and controlled flight with a man on board before December 17, 1903, the executors of the estate would have the right to take possession of the machine once again." Thus for many decades now, the Smithsonian hasn't been in any position to champion Langley-or Herring or Ader or anyone other than Orville and Wilbur-in presenting the history of powered flight to the American public.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-24So are we celebrating the centennial at the proper time? Do the Wrights' December 1903 flights near Kitty Hawk really give the state of North Carolina the right to stamp "First in Flight" on its license plates? The complicated answer may be that a continuum of critical advances in aviation took place during the final decade of the 19th century and the initial decade of the 20th. Picking a single point along that line to celebrate-December 17, 1903-may be a little arbitrary, but it makes for a good national party. And, anyway, there isn't enough room on a license plate to say, "First in Sustained, Piloted, Controlled, Powered, Heavier-than-Air Flight of Lasting Technological Significance."-David Schneider

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-24We humans have an extensive acquaintance with epidemics and pandemics. Many occurred long before the modern era with its current ease of global travel or any concerns about a changing climate. Our written record of epidemics can be traced as far back as the Ten Plagues of Egypt, which devastated livestock and humans. There are extensive and graphic descriptions of the prior pandemic spread of bubonic plague in Europe and Asia in the Middle Ages that occurred in successive waves.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-24In more recent history, during the First World War in the fall of 1918, influenza ravaged populations worldwide accounting for an estimated 20 million to 40 million deaths. It moved with astounding speed and at such a pace that more American troops died of influenza than in battle. Although there had been mild outbreaks of influenza in the spring of 1918, few deaths had occurred. However, within a short interval, a new strain of influenza virus emerged and was incredibly lethal, often leading to death within hours of symptoms caused by uncontrollable hemorrhage into the lungs.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-24This pandemic was so sudden and unprecedented, and it exerted its worldwide effect with such fury, a state of panic and chaos was experienced by many communities across the globe. Fatalities were not confined to the very young, elderly and infirm, as is the typical distribution for influenza. Instead, it disproportionately afflicted young adults and the previously healthy. This reversed the normal pattern of mortality so that its impact on the infrastructure of society had critical socioeconomic reverberations.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-24Now Ebola has raised global alarm. Although the spread of Ebola does not appear to follow the same mode of transmission as influenza, there are certain commonalities among any of the diseases that are currently considered to have the potential for worldwide spread. Both influenza and Ebola are zoonoses, just like the viruses that spread HIV, SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome), or West Nile virus. A zoonosis is an infection spread from one species to another, from animals to man or from man to another animal. The majority of human pathogens are zoonotic and nearly all the emerging diseases are caused by zoonotic pathogens.

We interact with other animals by hunting across a broad range and consuming a great variety of other species for food. We are eager travellers and keep and travel with diverse pets. Modern technology has dramatically changed our speed and ability to do so.

We, as humans, are not merely the victims of disease, but an important carrier of an immense amount of microbial life and may inadvertently introduce to novel pathogens through our actions.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-24As a result, relatively obscure diseases are now being granted a larger global range. Once a new disease emerges outside of its prior range, our cultural traditions can have a crucial impact on its dissemination. Societies can react idiosyncratically to vaccination programs, have long-standing burial rituals, or access to vastly different health resources. Stigmatization of the ill, traditional health practices in some cultures, handling of wastes and secretions, perceptions of individual rights, or acceptance of an imperative to quarantine can widely differ between cultures.

Disease recognizes no boundaries of class distinction, ethnicity, language, race or religion. If properly understood, this tragic epidemic is a gateway to a crucial international dialogue. A global action plan should be swiftly formulated and implemented based on our experiences with this current tragedy.

Printed by Peter Koch Printers, only four hundred and twenty five copies were issued by Rainmaker Editions of Las Vegas, Nevada. The five free verse poems are extraordinary because they represent Morrison's first and only foray into verse, and also because each poem is accompanied by a silhouette image by contemporary artist Kara Walker. Surprisingly, these poems have yet to receive any critical attention and have been omitted from Morrison bibliographies.1

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-26Five Poems remains largely unknown because of the limited copies produced by Peter Koch Printers and because Rainmaker Editions disintegrated soon after the book was printed. Promotion for Five Poems has been limited to the websites of Peter Koch Printers and the Black Mountain Institute, which absorbed Rainmaker Editions in 2006. Five Poems also does not have an International Standard Book Number (ISBN), an identification usually assigned to a text by the publisher, and therefore it does not appear in library catalogs, though a few universities and public collections have the book.2 Moreover, in the numerous interviews Morrison has given since the publication of Five Poems she has never mentioned the book or discussed her approach to writing poetry.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-26The partnership between Morrison and Walker is both remarkable and unprecedented. Although Walker has cited Morrison as a key influence on her artistic development and critics have begun to analyze intersections in their work, Five Poems is the first demonstration of collaboration between two of the most important living African American artists.3 To learn more about the origin of this project, I contacted the printer Peter Koch who explained that initially Morrison was invited by Wole Soyinka on behalf of Rainmaker Editions to submit an original unpublished manuscript.4 Morrison sent five short poems, the full text of the collection. Concerned that the seventy-eight lines of the poems would be too short, Koch suggested including illustrations to supplement the text. He independently recommended contacting Walker, an artist whose work he believed would complement that of Morrison. The publishers at Rainmaker agreed to this arrangement and Walker was sent the poems. As Koch explains, Morrison and Walker never actually met to discuss their collaboration and did not have any contact regarding this project. It is important to note that Walker's images were produced in response to the poems, and Morrison did not revise or respond formally to the accompanying illustrations. This fact informs my approach to Five Poems as I focus primarily on the poems and refer to the silhouettes only as they elucidate Morrison's images and ideas. This essay does not attempt to provide a comprehensive analysis of Morrison and Walker's collaboration, but rather seeks to relate the poems to Morrison's previous works and to initiate a critical dialogue on a stunning project.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-26Five Poems was published three years after the completion of Morrison's trilogy of novels-comprised of Beloved (1987), Jazz (1992), and Paradise (1999)-and demonstrates continued engagement with the themes and ideas at the forefront of those texts: love, mortality, transgression, memory, and the complex relationship between women and desire.5 The poems are all quite short; the longest contains twenty lines and the shortest only nine. Most are written in free verse and use rhyme idiosyncratically. They employ a variety of perspectives including the first, second, and third person singular, and often the context of each poem is vague, removing them from specific social and historical settings. The poems do not directly reference one another; instead they draw upon a network of images explored throughout Morrison's trilogy, linking scenes and ideas from the three novels in unexpected and elucidating ways. Although Beloved is not specifically mentioned in the poems, they are productively read as a development of Morrison's initial representation of this enigmatic figure. While critics continue to argue about who she is and what she represents (is she a ghost? an escaped slave unrelated to Sethe? a figure of the Middle Passage? a symbol of slavery's horrors?), the rampant and varied allusions to Beloved in the poems attest to the dynamic potential of this key literary figure.6

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-26The re-imagined Beloved depicted in Five Poems combines aspects of the Biblical Eve and the voice animating the ancient Scriptural manuscript, "Thunder, Perfect Mind." This new representation of Beloved draws upon key aspects of the Gnostic Gospels, a collection of texts about the teachings of Jesus that were written around the second century AD. In interviews, Morrison has referenced many of the central teachings of the Gnostic Gospels including the idea that salvation is located in the individual, not in an external divinity, and the importance of female figures in religious practice. The work of Elaine Pagels, a noted scholar of early Christianity and a former colleague of Morrison at Princeton University, explains that these writings, discovered in 1945, were not included in the standard Biblical canon because they presented ideas considered dangerous to the authority of the early church fathers. For example, followers of Gnosticism revered Eve as a divine revealer who represents the adventurous soul seeking spiritual union. In her exploration of this conception of Eve, Morrison also responds to her own earlier comments concerning the importance of the ancestor in African American literature.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-26In "Rootedness: The Ancestor as Foundation, " Morrison describes the figure of the ancestor as a key component of African American literature. She explains, "There is always an elder there. And these ancestors are not just parents, they are sort of timeless people whose relationships to the characters are benevolent, instructive, and protective, and they provide a certain kind of wisdom" (2289). In this essay, Morrison identifies Pilate of Song of Solomon (1977) as an ancestor, but in the trilogy novels, the figure of the ancestor is more vexed. Beloved might be understood as an ancestral presence since she bears stories of the past, but she is also a destructive influence. Jazz begins with the sound "Sth," and in a novel that abounds with failed parental figures (Violet's mother commits suicide, Joe is abandoned, and Alice stifles Dorcas, ultimately encouraging her dangerous rebellion), this sound registers the very absence of ancestral figures. "Sth" is just two absent vowels away from "Sethe, " a character who emerges at the end of Beloved reconciled with much of her past and ready to accept herself as her own "best thing" (273). Sethe is positioned to provide the wisdom so sorely needed by the characters of Jazz who flee rather than confront their personal histories. Instead, Violet falls into the cracks of her mind and Joe is haunted by his absent mother who may in fact be the vanished Beloved. Similarly in Paradise, the town elders, Steward and Deacon Morgan, are misguided adherents to tradition, not guardians of timeless wisdom. Only Consolata has "benevolent, instructive, and protective" relationships, but even as she nurtures the Convent women, she despises their neediness, and "more and more she wanted to snap their necks" (222).

However, Morrison also here asserts that there is a definitive "message" to her novels, a notion that is affirmed by how she understands the novel's purpose with respect to African American life:

But new information has got to get out, and there are several ways to do it. One is the novel. I regard it as a way to accomplish certain strong functions-one being the one I just described. ("Rootedness" 2286)

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-26Morrison understands the novel as "didactic" in how it explains to readers "what their responsibilities were and who and where was evil, and where was good" (2286). However, by presenting her "message" through "taking something away," Morrison fashions novels that are structured by absence and loss. In the trilogy novels, this involves respectively the absence of the beloved, the absence of a stable self, and the absence of paradise.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-26Morrison's poems, however, offer a very different approach to the form by which her "message" is conveyed. They envision an ancestor who is marked by presence rather than absence. All but one of the poems, the second, entitled "The Perfect Ease of Grain," features a prominent ancestral figure; however, even this work focuses on the ancestor by describing the longing for a departed woman. While each of the five poems explore the ancestor in some capacity, it is important to note that Morrison does not provide readers with a stable image of this critical figure. The first and last poems adopt a first person perspective, while the fourth highlights the beguiling nature of its subject through the title, "It Comes Unadorned." This ambiguity of subject position and identity is one of the central aspects of Beloved, as presented in the novel, and of the ancestral figure Morrison depicts in Five Poems. Such instability is most evident in the first poem, "Eve Remembering," which presents a wholly unrepentant Eve who seeks to both "scale" and "be" the "summit." This Eve bears a striking resemblance to Beloved, who may be understood to narrate the final poem, "I Am Not Seaworthy"; both women represent the return of memory, embody oppositions, possess forbidden knowledge, and demonstrate transgressive female power. By tracing a line of descent from Eve to Beloved, Morrison re-configures our understanding of the original female ancestor as a divine, immortal presence who operates beyond history. Five Poems reveals Morrison's commitment to many of the central ideas present in the Gnostic Gospels including reverence for a female deity and illumination through spiritual self-discovery. The ancestral figure present in these poems endorses critical values such as the virtue of transgression and the unity found in oppositions, providing readers with a discernable message, or what we might understand as a gospel according to Morrison.

While orthodox Christians understood Genesis as a warning against disobedience, the Gnostic Christians found virtue in transgression. As Pagels explains, "instead of blaming the human desire for knowledge as the root of all sin, they did the opposite and sought redemption through gnosis" (68).7 From this perspective, Eve is not the origin of sin, but instead "represents the higher principle, the spiritual self" who welcomes discovery and adventure (66).

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-26This conception of a liberated, passionately curious, and questing Eve is explored in Morrison's opening poem, "Eve Remembering." Narrated in the first-person, the poem describes Eve's decision to eat the fruit of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. Plucking the "apple / Fire red and humming," she states, "I bit sweet power to the core." She continues, "The taste undid my eyes / And led me far from gardens planted for a child." Eden is no paradise. Instead the garden is figured as a place of constraint and limitation, a reoccurring motif in Five Poems. As Eve is cast into an unexplored world of freedom and independence, there is no mention of her male companion. Instead she states in the second stanza that "Lips forget what they have kissed," implying that her beloved mate has been supplanted by the possibilities of new knowledge. Eve seeks not a partner, but the achievement of her wide-ranging desires.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-26Morrison creates an Eve who proudly claims in the final stanza, "I would do it all over again." She celebrates transgression and in her escape from the restrictions of Eden, she becomes an entity unbound by conventional forms of subjectivity. The subsequent lines suggest a confusion of position and power as Eve states, "Be the harbor and set the sail / Loose the breeze and harness the gale." This is an Eve who will both act as home and launch into the unknown, who will both free and shackle the wind. These striking oppositions indicate movement beyond the safety of the garden as well as subject positions with malleable boundaries. To have dominion over the "breeze" and the "gale" implies a power of divine proportions. The poem concludes: "Better the summit to scale. / Better the summit to be." This Eve is not content simply to mount the summit; she desires to be the summit.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-26Morrison's Eve focuses her desires upon the fulfillment of her personal powers and does not seem to yearn for a companion. The accompanying silhouette by Walker confirms this conception of a highly independent Eve though it dispenses with the image of the apple. The illustration depicts a woman dressed in a long gown that is reminiscent of nineteenth-century finery. Given Walker's history of encoding race through exaggerated physical characteristics, her protuberant lips mark her as black. This along with the gown, which is explicitly linked to Beloved in the novel, suggests that Walker also perceived a confluence between these two key figures.8 Most notably, however, the woman in the illustration discards a banana peel, not an apple core, in a casual downward gesture as she heads towards the right side of the picture's frame, which remains entirely blank. This startling use of negative space emphasizes the forward thrust of her movement and anticipates the culmination of her desire. The banana carries an obvious phallic meaning that is consistent with the way in which Morrison's Eve discards her male companion for "wilderness deeper than any master's call." We might read "master" as referring to Adam, but the word may also be interpreted as signifying God. In any case, this ambiguity emphasizes the poem's focus on Eve and underscores the fact that this master, whoever he or she may be, has no power over her.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-26Morrison's description of a Biblical female figure who possesses divine powers and shifts between oppositional subject positions resonates with the narrator of "Thunder, Perfect Mind," a poem discovered among the Gnostic manuscripts at Nag Hammadi in 1945. Morrison quotes this paradoxical text in both the epigraphs to Jazz and Paradise.9 Jorunn Jacobsen Buckley describes the poem's speaker as "a female revealer" who "proclaims herself to embody contrasting traits and antithetical natures, and the speaker appears in several realms simultaneously. Seemingly irreconcilable characteristics pertain to her across limits of space and time" (259). These perplexing oppositions resemble the aspirations of Morrison's Eve who departs from Eden eager to discover her power.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-26Bentley Layton describes "Thunder, Perfect Mind" as a combination of three literary modes of the ancient Mediterranean world: the Wisdom proclamation, the philosophical sermon, and the Greek identity riddle (44). In the latter form, the subject is described in bewildering contradictions and the solution reveals the identity of the speaker. One such example, cited in Layton's translation of The Gnostic Scriptures, is: "No one seeing me sees me, but one who does not see beholds me. One who does not speak speaks; one who does not run runs. And I am a liar, yet say all things true" (78). The answer is a dream. Although the speaker of "Thunder, Perfect Mind" is not clearly identified, Layton postulates that she is Eve, citing the lost Gospel of Eve as a key antecedent to the poem's persona (51). However, the Eve of "Thunder, Perfect Mind" is not a mortal human, but instead she represents a figure of divine, transformative power. In the opening section, she describes herself in a series of provocative dualities:

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-26The Biblical Eve clearly embodies many of these oppositions; she is both honored as the mother of humanity and scorned for her original sin. Her birth and crime cast her simultaneously as "the whore and the holy one." However, the line, "I am the first and the last" recalls God's proclamation in the New Testament, "I am the Alpha and the Omega" (Revelation 1:8). This Eve represents an evolution of spiritual power towards omnipotent divinity. As demonstrated by the lines previously quoted from "Eve Remembering," Morrison's narrator also exhibits a desire to occupy multiple subject positions and to claim power beyond the human realm. Although Morrison depicts Eve more closely with her expulsion from Eden rather than as an abstracted spiritual deity, her ambition points to such eventual fulfillment. These various but intertwined figures of Eve demonstrate a spectrum of development and possibility that also highlight the multiple ways we may interpret Morrison's representation of Beloved.

However, through its strong intertextual relationship with Beloved and Morrison's 1987 essay, "The Site of Memory," this work affirms the garden as a site of restriction and misguided comfort.10 Arguably the most accessible piece in the collection, "The Perfect Ease of Grain" describes a scene of harvest and natural beauty. However, a sense of danger and unrest pervades its twenty lines as "Evening lips part to hush / Questions raised at dawn." The secrecy of plans made at night suggests an urgent need to escape despite "The perfect ease of grain." The lush bounty of the earth does not extend its "ease" to those who admire such beauty; rather, the poem creates an opposition between natural abundance and a longing for human intimacy and union, particularly with a beloved woman.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-26Although the poem does not directly refer to a specific historical context, the images of the opening stanzas strongly resonate with a key scene in Beloved. Following Sethe's choice of Halle as her husband, the two have sex for the first time in Mr. Garner's cornfield. They mistakenly believe that they are well hidden in the corn, but in fact they are fully exposed to the rest of the Sweet Home men who must cool themselves with water as they watch "corn stalks dance at noon." In their careless romp in the field, Sethe and Halle break the young stalks, which Sixo and the Pauls then collect for a "feast of new corn." The scene mixes harvest with hardship, beauty with longing, and takes on a poetic quality of its own as Morrison repeats the fragmented line, "How loose the silk," three times in a single page, concluding, "How fine and loose and free" (27). This unexpected use of verse marks the passage as distinct from the rest of the novel, suggesting that the themes and images here are best expressed through poetry rather than prose. In this way, the scene seems to anticipate the confluence of ideas revisited in "The Perfect Ease of Grain."

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-26In both "The Perfect Ease of Grain" and the cornfield scene in Beloved, Morrison establishes a contrast between the bounty of the harvest grain and the longing caused by a woman. Sixo and the Pauls physically pine for Sethe, or at least a woman of their own, and though Halle consummates his marriage, as later demonstrated in the novel, his relationship to his wife is always mediated by the needs and demands of the Garners. Although Sethe has chosen him from all the Sweet Home men, the fulfillment of Halle's desire for her is restricted by his slave status. This sense of frustrated desire is also reflected in the promise of the corn; the Sweet Home men are only allowed to eat the broken stalks, and ultimately the harvest is not theirs to reap though of course they will be the ones to reap it. This abiding hunger is highlighted in Walker's accompanying silhouette which depicts a man wearing a farmer's hat. With one foot on the base of a thin, nearly leaf-bare tree, he leans in to touch his forehead to the trunk. This picture is perfectly reflected in what appears to be a pool of water, but the mirror image is cut offat his head, upsetting what would be a symmetrical image. Like the Sweet Home men, this male figure is without a companion and his abbreviated reflection illustrates the imbalance of his solitude.

Red cherries become jam"), predominate. As with the new corn consumed by the Sweet Home men, these descriptions contrast with the absence of a beloved and the unsatisfied hunger for human intimacy. This absence is made most explicit at the end of stanza four, which reads, "When goodbye is 'So long.'" Again this line may be fruitfully read with reference to a scene in Beloved. After confronting Sethe with his knowledge of her infanticide, Paul D walks out of 124 Bluestone. Although they both know that he will not return, he still asks that she set aside dinner for him. Sethe reflects on this bit of cowardly kindness:

She here expresses some hope of reunion while also denying the full consequences of his decision to leave. Moreover, "So long" describes the ache of desire leftin his absence, a continual hurt which is occluded by the finality of saying "goodbye." As in "The Perfect Ease of Grain," the departure signified by "goodbye" prompts a prolonged yearning for the beloved. In this way, the abundance of the harvest presents an ironic contrast to a far deeper hunger for intimacy and comfort.

The image of the train shifts the poem out of the historical context of antebellum slavery and into a more contemporary environment, which anticipates the setting of Jazz, the second novel in Morrison's trilogy. Joe Trace of Jazz is also haunted by the "flavor of a woman"; he is first obsessed by Wild, the mother who abandoned him, and then by Dorcas, the young girl with whom he has an adulterous affair and who he successfully hunts as he could not do with his mother. As part of the Great Migration, Joe and his wife Violet leave their Southern hometowns for the promise of a better life, and aboard a train heading north, they first feel the contagious and intoxicating energy of New York. The train's "trembling became the dancing under their feet," and while they are both enamored by the exciting possibilities before them, as the novel later demonstrates, Joe proves to be well ensnared by the "flavor of a woman" as he is unable to escape his unrequited desire for Dorcas (30). His nostalgia for the country life he leftin the South also affirms the opposition between "The perfect ease of grain" and more complicated affairs of the heart.

In this essay, she describes how she "track(s) an image from picture to meaning to text," illustrating her technique by referencing a scene in Beloved, which coincidentally is that of the cornfield previously mentioned. The reappearance of these images and meanings in "The Perfect Ease of Grain" indicates the power of these interconnected references which, as Morrison explains, originate from her childhood memories:

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-26I have quoted this essay at some length because it highlights a series of interconnected ideas and descriptions that constitute a network of images explored in "The Perfect Ease of Grain." The conception of the garden as a place of confinement also has key resonance to "Eve Remembering." In this passage, Morrison links the memory of corn with an image of her parents. Significantly, she recalls her parents walking away from her, towards an intimacy between themselves that begins in the garden but moves into the bedroom where the couple naps privately. The reference to the railroad tracks that her parents must cross recalls the train mentioned in "The Perfect Ease of Grain" and affirms a sense of lasting departure. Although the naps signal a degree of exclusion and privacy with obvious sexual implications, the girls revel in the freedom to do as they choose without parental oversight. Thus even as they are barred from sharing in their parents' naps, Morrison experiences another kind of joy. We may interpret this recollection as a type of primal scene as the young Morrison becomes aware of her parents as desiring sexual subjects. However, her memory is not tainted by the trauma usually associated with Freud's conception of this key moment in one's development towards independent subjectivity. Rather, Morrison understands her parents' seclusion as an opportunity to do as she pleases. By highlighting her freedom, Morrison presents the garden as a place of limitation; though it may be full of the harvest's bounty, she looks towards the fulfillment of her own will and desire.

The conflated memory of her parents in their private garden or alone taking their naps is somehow organically linked in Morrison's psyche with the pleasure of eating corn. If we assume a chronological development, in the feast that follows her parents' separation from their daughters, family unity is restored. Eating extends even to uncles, aunts, and neighbors; this is a joy shared not privately but rather delighting in communion. Morrison's childhood memory does not partake of the same intensity of longing that characterizes the cornfield scene in Beloved and "The Perfect Ease of Grain"; instead she is positioned outside the union between her parents. They walk away from her towards an intimacy that she does not share. As with the Sweet Home men, the feast of corn provides a degree of social unity, but the promise of sexual fulfillment remains elusive. Significantly, however, Morrison does not express a frustrated sexual desire of her own, indicating the broad nature of her curiosity about the world outside her parents' garden; sex is incidental to her new freedom.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-26In the passage from "Site of Memory," Morrison adds that she likes corn not only for its sweet taste but because she is able to recognize it among the other plants. This detail is significant given her comment that she is not allowed into her parents' garden because she cannot distinguish crops from weeds. As I have suggested, the garden is an easy figure for Eden, and the young Morrison, unable to discriminate between good and evil, functions as a pre-lapsarian figure who does not fully understand the sexual nature of her parents' naps. However, Morrison's exile from their garden is a reversal of the original expulsion of Adam and Eve who cannot return to Eden once they have eaten the forbidden fruit. Although this imposition of tropes may seem overwrought, the inversion apparent here is consistent with Morrison's approach to innocence and guilt throughout her novels. As Terry Otten notes, Morrison explores the notion of "the fortunate fall" in her novels to demonstrate how "'evil' paradoxically may lead to freedom, self-awareness, an authentic self" (97). This approach is consistent with ideas presented by such Gnostic followers as Ptolemy who argues "the story of Adam and Eve shows that humanity 'fell' into ordinary consciousness and lost contact with its divine origin" (Pagels 65). The trope of the restrictive garden may be pressed even further if we recall the bountiful nature of Sethe and Halle's cornfield and the deceptive "ease of grain." This comparison implies that Eden may be read as a site of bondage, a place of lush beauty but devoid of free will. Although I am not suggesting that slavery be understood as a type of Eden, Morrison's network of images presents the garden in its many forms as suspect. Consequently, we may better understand the young Morrison in "Site of Memory" who rejects all restraints, departing from her parents' garden in order to discover the possibilities of her own self.

Its allusions to Beloved initiate a key parallel between Eve and the longing for a beloved woman. Like the bold, transgressive Eve of Morrison's first poem, the woman recalled in "The Perfect Ease of Grain" has moved on to discover other places. This adventurous spirit is reflected in Morrison's recollection of herself in "Site of Memory," suggesting an association between all three figures: Eve, Beloved, and now Morrison. Like the Gnostic Gospels that affirm the divine being within every person, Morrison's poems demonstrate that the ancestor of African American literature may already exist in the author of these lines.

Morrison's poem describes a second-person subject: "You wait, longing to hear / Words of reason, love or play." This "you" is caught in an ambiguous state of mind, uncertain how to proceed: "You shore up your heart to run. To stay. / But no sign or design marks the narrow way." The reference to possible flight may suggest that the "you" is a slave contemplating escape, but there are no specific descriptions to provide a clear historical context for the poem. Rather, the focus of "Someone Leans Near" involves how its subject finds comfort through the unspecified presence of another. This change is described in the final stanzas of the poem:

George MacRae describes the speaking Thunder as "allegorized as Perfect Mind, meaning the extension of the divine into the world" (296), while Pagels identifies its "spirit, manifested variously as Wisdom and as Eve" (67). Buckley understands Thunder's purpose to be both the liberation and salvation of her listeners, but notes that, "Both superior and suffering, the Thunder resides in the upper worlds and below, seeking realization on earth, in the minds of the believers" (264). Consequently, the revelation of Thunder's presence depends upon the changed consciousness of her audience. Pagels explains that according to the Secret Book of John Eve specifically awakens Adam to "recognize her, and so receive spiritual illumination" (67).

In the penultimate stanza, the line is set in quotation marks, suggesting that it is spoken by the "someone" who "leans near." The absence of quotation marks in the concluding line indicates that the "you" of the poem has internalized its meaning and become liberated from false beliefs. The ultimate message of "Thunder, Perfect Mind" and the "someone" of the poem is the same: death is an illusion. Significantly, the "you" does not hear an actual reply, but instead remembers "a call clear" implying that the "someone" is a ghostly presence who does not actually speak. There is no explicit contact between the two, and while the latter "sees the salt your tears have shed," the "someone" does not wipe them away. Moreover, the "breath" that "caresses" is sufficiently vague to suggest it may only be a passing breeze.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-26There are a number of important parallels between this passage and "Someone Leans Near." The intimacy of a "someone" who "leans near" suggests a "clamor for a kiss" while the passing "breath" might also figure as nothing more than weather. Though Beloved has vanished physically, she remains through the transformations of consciousness that occurred among those who knew her. Although as Morrison writes, "they forgot her like a bad dream," her presence persists in the ways that she has changed them (274). Paul D returns to stay, Denver leaves 124 Bluestone, and Sethe begins to understand herself as her own "best thing" (273). Each discovers the strength made possible by love. Similarly, in "Someone Leans Near," the subject of the poem understands her immortality through the caring presence of another. Although this "you" may be physically alone, she derives comfort and courage from the memory of another. Death presents no obstacle to the vibrancy of the living. This sentiment reappears at the end of Paradise as Billie Delia contemplates the mysterious absence of the Convent women. She concludes that the only remaining question is "When will they return?" (308). Just as the Convent women will reappear to again vanquish the false town of Ruby, so the leaning "someone" will also return to comfort and guide the living. This "someone" channels the ancestral properties of both Beloved and the Convent women by promising continuity and the eternal life expressed in "Thunder, Perfect Mind."

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-26The final poems in the collection, "It Comes Unadorned" and "I Am Not Seaworthy," exemplify the strongest connection to the riddling form of "Thunder, Perfect Mind." The first of these two lists a series of puzzling descriptions involving an "it" that is never specifically defined: "It comes / Unbidden, / Like the turn of sun through hills / Or stars in wheels of song." What is the solution to this riddle? In the seventy-two words of this poem, the images are diffuse and abstract: "The jeweled feet of women dance the earth, / arousing it to spring. . . . It comes naked into the world like a charm." These intangible descriptions lead me to conclude that the poem is a meditation on repressed memory or what Sethe terms "rememory" which, as characterized in the poem, "comes / Unadorned / Like a phrase / Strong enough to cast a spell." The power of memory to conjure the past and to arrive without prior anticipation, but rather in response to the natural world ("the turn of sun through hills") recalls Sethe's explanation of her rememory to Denver and the way in which certain landscapes possess individual memories:

Right in the place where it happened. (Beloved 36)

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-26Sethe describes rememory as images and events of her life that persist even if she represses them; they abide, independent of both her volition and her existence. In this way, they operate simultaneously as a part of her in that the memories are derived from her past, and separate from her because she cannot control their presence. Coming both "unadorned" and "unbidden," these rememories live and pass through the physical world and represent what Caroline Rody terms a "supernatural phenomenon" that "postulates the interconnectedness of minds, past and present" (101). Within the context of the novel, Beloved may be understood as the embodiment of rememory, the irrepressible return of history.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-26The adjoining image by Walker, in which a woman appears to fly through layers of clouds, confirms this conception of Beloved as symbolic of the traumatic history of antebellum slavery. Her arrival to 124 Bluestone causes the inhabitants of the house to return to their most painful memories. Although Beloved is initially a disruptive force who attempts to sever Sethe's ties to Paul D and Denver, "It Comes Unadorned" concludes with images of unity among disparate people: "Shoulders broad as a road bend to share the weight of years. / Profiles breach the distance and lean / Toward an ordinary kiss. Bliss." The first line suggests a younger generation coming to the aid of elders as if shared memory prompts recognition of youth's responsibility to collective burdens. In the final line, memory encourages physical intimacy-a kiss that becomes bliss. Thus to read the poem's solution as Beloved implies that a return to painful memories can result in social harmony. At the novel's end, Sethe and Paul D reunite though significantly Beloved has been expelled. Rememory, which comes "Unadorned" and "Unbidden," just as the ghostly Beloved arrived to Sethe, may leave in her wake stronger bonds between the living. Moreover, the poem's reference to "an ordinary kiss" echoes the conclusion of Beloved in which the forgotten Beloved becomes "Just weather. Certainly no clamor for a kiss" (275). Significantly, "It Comes Unadorned" shifts that kiss involving a ghostly presence to the realm of the "ordinary," presumably like a kiss between Sethe and Paul D. This union demonstrates how an external, even supernatural presence can have real-life consequences. Like the ancestral figure depicted in "Someone Leans Near," the subject of "It Comes Unadorned" provides comfort to the living. Both poems expand upon the figure of Beloved by presenting beings linked to continuities of memory and eternal life.

This repeated image suggests a confluence between these two key female figures-the proud, transgressive Eve and the memory-imbued Beloved. This parallel does not imply that we are to read them as simplistic substitutions for one another, but the comparison does provide fruitful inquiry into how Eve and Beloved are similar. Both possess forbidden knowledge; Eve has eaten the illicit apple and Beloved knows the horrors of slavery and how a mother's love can turn into violence. These powerful women also have the ability to transform those around them through the desire that they inspire in others. To extend this comparison to one between Beloved and the voice of "Thunder, Perfect Mind," that is, the transformed Eve, we may also understand how both figures seek revelation from those around them. Beloved inspires Sethe to confront her past and thereby live freely in the present, while Thunder implores listeners to reconcile opposing dualities and seek spiritual self-discovery.

The narrator does not explicitly define him or herself, but instead provides a series of puzzling descriptions that are exemplified in the poem's opening lines: "I am not seaworthy / Look how the fish mistake my hair for home." This latter image has a direct referent in Beloved. Following Beloved's mysterious disappearance, "a little boy put it out how he had been looking for bait back of 124, down by the stream, and saw, cutting through the woods, a naked woman with fish for hair" (267). The poem's allusion to this striking description suggests that Beloved may also be the answer to its riddle although in this poem she is not an abstracted figure of rememory as in "It Comes Unadorned." The Beloved figure referenced here is one who returns to the water from which she emerged and who in departing from Sethe, signifies memories of more collective import.

The Beloved of "I Am Not Seaworthy" is a victim of the Middle Passage, a woman borne across the ocean to bondage in America. Many critics have read the Beloved of the novel as an embodied memory of the Middle Passage, citing the section in which Beloved describes "the men without skin" who have trapped her on a boat (210). Both Elizabeth House and Iyunolu Osagie posit readings of Beloved as an African woman carried on a slaveship, and demonstrate how she may be interpreted as a unique, physical individual and not a ghostly presence or the reincarnation of Sethe's murdered daughter. They cite Beloved's memory of a woman collecting flowers as evidence of her happy life in Africa that is subsequently destroyed by the men who force her into bondage. Such violent disruption is echoed in "I Am Not Seaworthy," whose narrator states, "I had a life, like you. I shouldn't be riding the sea." The voice asks to be "earth bound; star fixed / Mixed with sun and smacking air." Although the Beloved of the novel eventually lands in America, this suggestion of a perpetual journey may represent a more general desire for safety and comfort. The poem concludes by returning to the image of the fish who "mistake my hair for home," again implying the displacement of the narrator. This longing is only satisfied in Walker's image as the stork-like bird carries offthe baby-if not to return the child home then perhaps to a place of new beginnings.

By bracketing Five Poems with the voices of Eve and Beloved, Morrison establishes them as key ancestral figures. They are best understood not as substitutes for one another but as figures who embody certain fundamental traits such as the return of memory, multiple subject positions, and transgressive female power. They model a kind of transcendent wisdom that is not bound to a specific social and historical context. This lack of textual certitude reflects the way in which the Gnostics also encouraged interpretive play in their reading of Scriptural texts. As Pagels explains:

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-26These Gnostics took each line of the Scriptures as an enigma, a riddle pointing to deeper meaning. Read this way, the text became a shimmering surface of symbols, inviting the spiritually adventurous to explore its hidden depths, to draw upon their own inner experience- what artists call the creative imagination-to interpret the story. (64)

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-26This approach to texts undermines the authority of any single reading, and instead suggests a type of truth that is found only in the juxtaposition of differing interpretations. Morrison's novelistic presentation of Beloved welcomes varied readings of her significance, and in Five Poems, she pushes this unstable signifier even further. Here Beloved becomes an ancestral presence who bears striking similarities to both Eve and the speaker of "Thunder, Perfect Mind." Like the Gnostic texts lost until 1945, Five Poems has also escaped the attention of the scholarly community. And like those rediscovered writings, Five Poems provides fresh perspective on a critical body of work.

There is continued critical discussion as to how the trilogy novels are connected, though most scholars view love as the strongest link between them. Megan Sweeney moves beyond this simplistic characterization to argue "Morrison's trilogy about love also provides a historically contextualized, multi-generational view of crime and the process of criminalization" (42). Sarah Appleton Aguilar contends that the texts are linked not only through migration but also via "a much deeper connection: that of the cycle of life itself" (513), while Rob Davidson focuses on how the trilogy explores the process of "'re-membering' the historical past" (355). All of these ideas are key to understanding Five Poems especially as they signify upon the meaning and representation of the figure of Beloved.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-26Democrats are hoping that gun control won't be an issue in next year's presidential election. Gun control is a loser at the polls, and Democrats know it, even if they are loath to admit it publicly.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-26Now, along comes Sen. Orrin Hatch (R.-Utah) to put a fly in the ointment by introducing a bill that puts gun control back in the spotlight and Democrats on the spot. Hatch's bill would repeal the District of Columbia's gun control law, one of the nation's toughest.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-26In 1976, the Washington, D.C., city council made it illegal for city residents to own guns. The new law required anyone who owned a legally registered gun to bring the firearm into the Metropolitan police headquarters to re-register it or face future prosecution.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-26At the time, I owned a revolver, which I had purchased after my husband was mugged in broad daylight, hit over the head with a two-by-four in front of our then 7-year-old son. We lived in a D.C. neighborhood that, while not among the city's highest crime areas, nonetheless had been plagued by break-ins and several rapes within blocks of our home.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-26I'll never forget the day I took my handgun downtown to re-register it under the new ordinance. The line stretched for several city blocks around the police headquarters and down toward Constitution Avenue. I was six months pregnant with our second child. My ankles were swollen, the sun and humidity were unbearable, and the gun-a .357 Magnum-weighed heavily in my purse. After waiting in line for a couple of hours and making little progress toward the police station, I gave up and went home. I worried all night that, with the new gun law's effective date just days away, I was about to become a felon.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-26The law had no effect in reducing Washington's appalling violent crime rate. The city consistently ranks among the nation's top seven in murders. Guns are plentiful on D.C. streets, yet law-abiding citizens may not own guns to protect themselves unless they were lucky enough to purchase and re-register them before Sept. 24, 1976.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-26I've often wondered how many other gun owners gave up that day and failed to re-register their guns. I was able to keep my gun legally by taking it to Virginia, where I owned a weekend house, and leaving it there until I permanently moved out of D.C. a few years later.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-26But what about the others in line, nearly all of whom were black and appeared to be working people-laborers, taxi drivers, shopkeepers? My guess is most of them lived in neighborhoods considerably more dangerous than mine. If they didn't make it to the front of the line that day, they faced an uneasy future. They could either keep their now illegal weapons for self-protection or give them up and be defenseless if someone broke into their homes or businesses.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-26According to a 1993 study by Florida State University criminologist Gary Kleck, gun owners use their weapons to protect themselves approximately two million times per year. Although some studies estimate a smaller number of defensive gun uses, at a minimum, tens of thousands of crimes are prevented each year because citizens can protect themselves when police arc not ready at hand to do so. Why then should law-abiding residents of the District of Columbia be left defenseless in a city teeming with illegal guns and criminals willing to use them?

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-26Sen. Hatch's bill has Democrats sputtering about "home rule" since it would overturn a city law, but they'd rather not talk about gun control per se so close to an election year. I don't blame them. There's no correlation between tough gun laws and lower crime. Indeed all the liberal prognostication on Florida's "right to carry" law, the first in the nation' in 1987, proved wrong. Not only did Florida's streets not turn Into public shooting galleries, as liberals predicted, but 24 other states have followed suit. There has been no discernible increase in violence as a result and not a single conviction of a permit-holder for killing an innocent party.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-26Sen. Hatch has the right idea.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/102/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27 Orwell's universe was "Big Brother," where individuality didn't exist for the protagonist, Winston Smith, and millions of others. Huxley imagined a place where the capabilities of humans are manufactured to create those at high levels and others with horribly limited skills and intelligence. At North Augusta High School, students Alyssa Jones and Carleigh Deal constructed with two classmates a standing art piece that reflected the books. The work of other students was displayed in the library on Monday and Tuesday.

Yet Huxley's vision is even more pervasive -- a depiction of subservience to become entertained and happy and numb.

Over Christianity's 2,000-year history, its message of love, charity, and self-sacrifice has kept the religion popular and influential, even in the face of relentless attacks. The Soviet Union, for example, shut down churches and waged an aggressive antireligion campaign, but Christianity has outlasted communism.

Indeed, Benedict did more during his eight-year reign to overcome the Great Schism of 1054 and the Protestant Reformation, and to promote interfaith dialogue, than any of his predecessors, including Pope John Paul II. In the process, he helped distinguish the Vatican's worldview from Washington's in important ways and paved the way for improved cooperation among Christians of various denominations on religious, moral, and political issues worldwide. Francis will undoubtedly continue this effort. In his native Argentina, he championed interfaith cooperation and dialogue.

According to the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life, Catholicism is growing fastest in Asia and Africa. Protestantism is also spreading globally: of the countries with the top ten Protestant populations, only two are in North America or Europe.

Ecumenism-the movement to unify Christianity- is on the rise, partly in response to secularization, which tends to marginalize Christianity's relevance, and partly in response to a recent escalation in violence against Christians around the world. A shared sense of vulnerability has drawn Christians closer together, but it took Benedict's push to institutionalize this effort in ways that will continue long after the end of his tenure.

The Second Vatican Council, a three-year assembly convened in the early 1960s, fundamentally changed how the church did business and made broad Christian unity possible. One of the council's key documents, Unitatis Redintegratio (Restoration of Unity), issued in 1964, identified "restoration of unity among all Christians" as a key long-term goal. The document described baptized Christians who profess faith in another church as "separated brethren," not as "heretics," the term commonly used for centuries prior. And in 1964, the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church canceled their mutual excommunications of one another (dating back to 1054), thereby allowing interchurch dialogue to begin.

He made specific inroads with several Protestant denominations, allowing former Episcopal priests to become Catholic priests and accepting some Episcopal parishes into the Catholic Church, as well as signing a joint declaration with the Lutheran World Federation that resolved a key doctrinal difference over what is known as "justification"-how a sinner gets to heaven. John Paul II was also the first pope to visit a majority Orthodox country: Romania, in 1999. Later, he also traveled to the Orthodox countries of Bulgaria, Georgia, Greece, and Ukraine. Still, he was never able to achieve his dream of meeting with Alexy II, then the Russian patriarch and one of the most powerful figures in the Eastern Orthodox Church.

But even after the collapse of communism, palpable tensions kept Catholics and Orthodox Christians apart. These disputes included Catholic property claims against the Russian state, which had expropriated, repurposed, or destroyed thousands of churches, monasteries, and ecclesiastic buildings during the Soviet era; Orthodox fears that Catholics and other missionary churches would sweep into Russia to woo believers; centuries of Polish-Russian rivalry; and missteps by the Vatican in how it structured new Catholic administrative units in Russia in the early 1990s.

In his first papal message to his former peers, assembled in the Sistine Chapel, Benedict (speaking in the third person) set forth a clear platform of Christian reconciliation: "The current Successor assumes as his primary commitment that of working tirelessly towards the reconstitution of the full and visible unity of all Christ's followers. This is his ambition, this is his compelling duty. He is aware that to do so, expressions of good feelings are not enough."

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27Benedict began his outreach almost immediately. On his first papal trip, to Germany four months later, Benedict met with an assembly of German evangelicals and Protestants and told them that ecumenism "does not mean uniformity in all expressions of theology and spirituality, in liturgical forms and in discipline." He declared, "Unity in multiplicity, and multiplicity in unity." The pope ended his talk with a call for collaboration: "Now let us all go along this path in the awareness that walking together is a form of unity." He also pledged to promote interfaith dialogue by stressing the unifying word of God and collaborating across faiths on issues such as the defense of life and the promotion of peace.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27Benedict soon inadvertently compromised his own plan to promote further dialogue, however. The next year, in a speech at the University of Regensburg, in Germany, Benedict quoted a fourteenth-century Byzantine emperor disparaging the founder of Islam: "Show me just what Mohammed brought that was new and there you will find things only evil and inhuman, such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached." The pope had quoted the emperor only in order to reflect on the question of whether acting unreasonably-for example, by forcing conversions through violence-was against God's nature. Benedict also took care to reject the "startling brusqueness" of the emperor's remark, calling it "unacceptable." But his citation was taken out of context and ignited protests throughout the Muslim world. The Vatican responded by conveying the pope's "sincere regret," but the rioting spread, leading to the bombing of churches in the West Bank and Gaza and the murder of a 65-year-old nun in Mogadishu, Somalia.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27The speech also unnerved the Vatican by unintentionally yoking the pope to negative perceptions of U.S. President George W. Bush's foreign policy that were prevalent in the Muslim world, where many people interpreted the pope's comments as an endorsement of a "war on Islam" led by the United States. In fact, Vatican diplomats had emphatically objected to one of the most significant elements of the "war on terror": the invasion of Iraq. John Paul II had even sent a personal envoy to discourage Bush from attacking Iraq. But the Regensburg speech made Benedict look like the champion of a strategy the Vatican strongly disapproved of, and it endangered the people and communities the pope most wanted to protect.

The initial purpose was to join Bartholomew I, the archbishop of Constantinople and the spiritual leader of the Eastern Orthodox Church, for the Feast of Saint Andrew. Many advisers counseled Benedict to cancel the trip because it was bound to spark more Muslim protests. Two days before the pope arrived, an estimated 25,000 people demonstrated against his visit in the streets of Istanbul.

He did this by visiting Istanbul's Sultan Ahmed Mosque, making him just the second pope in history to enter a Muslim holy place. Accompanied by Mustafa Cagrici, the mufti of Istanbul, and Emrullah Hatipoglu, the mosque's imam, Benedict removed his bright red loafers on entering as a sign of deference. Then, he stood next to Cagrici, facing Mecca, and recited a prayer- and in so doing managed to stanch Muslim fury through his show of respect.

As a result, for example, a year later, King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, the protector of Mecca, visited Rome, becoming the first Saudi monarch to visit a pope. (With about one million Catholics living in the kingdom, mostly guest workers from the Philippines with limited rights to practice their faith, the Vatican's interest in this relationship is practical.) And the pope was invited to Jordan and the Palestinian territories in 2009 and to Lebanon last September, which ended up being his last papal trip.

In a prayer service at the modest Church of Saint George, Bartholomew greeted the pontiffas a "beloved brother," and Benedict responded by quoting the 133rd psalm: "Behold, how good and pleasant it is when brothers dwell in unity." The two spoke at length about the ecumenical mission and the promotion of peace through love. They prayed together before relics of Saint John Chrysostom and Saint Gregory of Nazianzus, former bishops revered by both churches. The relics had been taken to Rome in 1204 after Constantinople was captured during the Fourth Crusade. Five months before his death, John Paul II had sent them back to the patriarchate of Constantinople.

During his visit, Benedict demonstrated how Muslim hostility can be dealt with by supporting local Christian communities that have historically served as bridges between the East and the West. Bartholomew visited Rome several times after that, mending the Great Schism a little more with each visit. In June 2008, the patriarch participated in a Mass in Saint Peter's Basilica with the pope, during which the two men recited the Nicene Creed together in Greek, leaving out a three-word phrase ("and the son") that the Orthodox do not accept. With this deftbit of statecraft, Benedict overcame-or at least sidestepped- a significant doctrinal disagreement that had prevented cooperation between the churches for centuries.

Kirill had served for 20 years as chair of the Russian Orthodox Church's Department for External Church Relations, a role that essentially made him the church's foreign minister. In that position, he was the Vatican's main interlocutor in the postcommunist era and had already established a working relationship with Benedict by the time he became patriarch. For both John Paul II and Benedict, according to Vatican insiders, Kirill's Orthodox clerical lineage contributed to their trust: his grandfather was a persecuted priest, arrested by the Soviets in 1933; his father was a priest; and his brother is an archpriest and theology professor.

For these men, both of whom lived through totalitarian oppression, rampant secularism is a harbinger of the kind of moral collapse that can lead to instability and even tyranny. They are also both wary of radical Islam and its threat to minority Christian populations around the world.

Between 1987 and 2009, the number of monasteries in Russia grew from three to 478, the number of seminaries increased from two to 25, and the number of churches skyrocketed by 550 percent, from 2,000 to 13,000.

In 2010, for the first time since the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, Russia and the Vatican exchanged ambassadors based on full diplomatic recognition. Benedict's outreach to Russia helped mend the centuries-long Polish-Russian divide, which in part explains the cold shoulder Moscow usually gave John Paul II. In the summer of 2012, the Roman Catholic bishops of Poland and the Russian Orthodox patriarch joined together in Poland to urge Poles and Russians to overcome their "mutual prejudice." It was the first time a Russian patriarch had ever visited modern Poland, and the event was broadcast live on Polish television.

During the visit, according to a U.S. State Department cable released by the whistleblower website WikiLeaks, Putin, who is a practicing Orthodox Christian, pledged that his government would "do all it can to favor dialogue between the two churches." The Vatican sees Russia, together with Europe and Latin America, as part of Western civilization-which is different from Washington's view.

Metropolitan Hilarion, the 46-year-old priest and composer who replaced Kirill as the church's leader for external relations, is a young star with an impressive resumé, a familiar face in Rome who is also comfortable in the United States and throughout Europe, and a determined advocate of ecumenism. He advocates the importance of the Catholic and Orthodox churches' coordinating their answers on moral questions and waging a coordinated fight against Western "Christophobia." In 2009, for example, the European Court of Human Rights declared that Italian public schools should remove all crucifixes from their classrooms because they are violations of the Europe Convention on Human Rights. The Roman Catholic, Russian Orthodox, and Greek Orthodox churches successfully worked together to reverse the ruling.

During this trip, Benedict became the first pope to enter Westminster Abbey, which had been a Catholic Benedictine abbey until King Henry VIII converted it into an Anglican cathedral after England's split with Rome in the mid-sixteenth century. Henry VIII's dispute with Catholicism centered on papal primacy; on most other matters, the king agreed with Catholic theology. As a result, there are few doctrinal differences between the Roman Catholic Church and the Church of England (known as the Episcopal Church in the United States), easing the task of reconciliation.

In 2011, against the advice of British bishops, the pope created a unique canonical structure to receive groups of Anglicans into full communion with Rome. Benedict established three "personal ordinariates," in the United Kingdom, the United States, and Australia, to accommodate clergy (including married priests, but not married bishops) and believers who want to convert to Catholicism while maintaining "liturgical, spiritual, and pastoral traditions." Each ordinariate is led by a former Anglican priest who has executive authority over the community and reports directly to the pope. The Vatican says it crafted this policy in response to requests from hundreds of Anglicans around the world, including over 50 bishops, who expressed interest in joining the church without losing their traditions.

Anglican leaders viewed Benedict's actions not as poaching but as a means of preserving a common Christian identity. Reacting to the pope's resignation, Justin Welby, who replaced Williams as the archbishop of Canterbury in early 2013, praised Benedict's "great dignity, insight, and courage." Francis, too, is respected by Anglican leaders. Gregory Venables, the former archbishop for the Anglican Church of the Southern Cone of America, recently described Francis as "much more of a Christian, Christ centered and Spirit filled, than a mere churchman. He is consistently humble and wise, outstandingly gifted yet a common man."

Broadly speaking, Protestantism, which began as a reaction to corruption in Rome, makes four main claims against Catholic theology. First, Protestants believe that salvation is obtained through faith in Jesus Christ, whereas Catholics hold that salvation is an ongoing event in which God's grace creates faith and inspires good works. Second, Protestantism rejects the Catholic hierarchy of bishops led by a pope. Third, Protestantism holds that the Bible alone is enough to guide the faithful, whereas Catholics believe that church teachings and writings throughout history are also authoritative. Fourth, most Protestant denominations interpret the Eucharist as a symbolic representation of Christ's sacrifice, whereas Catholics believe the Eucharist is the real presence of Christ.

This phrase overcame almost 500 years of theological dispute and paved the way for a shared future. The statement also nullified past mutual condemnations. And in 2006, the World Methodist Council, representing 80 million people worldwide, voted unanimously to sign the agreement as well.

The ecumenical magazine Christianity Today has called Francis "a pope for all Christians," and he is known for befriending, praying with, and studying the Bible with religious leaders of different faiths.

In the developed world, where Christianity is threatened by secularization and materialism, the forces that unite the faithful-namely, the core beliefs that Christ is Lord and Savior and that loving one's neighbor is a spiritual requirement- are more powerful than the somewhat obscure doctrinal differences that divide them.

The Roman Catholic Church has diplomatic relations with 180 countries and maintains a permanent observer status in most un organizations. When defending a Christian who has been jailed for his or her beliefs-as is happening with greater frequency, especially in Muslim-majority countries-this diplomatic network offers Christians of all stripes a powerful resource. Furthermore, Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant leaders outside the United States believe that U.S. foreign policy since 2003, with its heavy reliance on military intervention and minimal respect for local cultures and traditions, has disastrously jeopardized Christians and the cause of peaceful dialogue around the world.

Not waiting around for formal doctrine to catch up, this Christian community is a strong force for ecumenical collaboration. It considers it urgent, not optional, to work together.

In addition, institutional mechanisms for dialogue, such as the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity, have built up momentum that is unlikely to dissipate. And Francis is personally committed to Christian unity. For the past ten years, he has been an active leader of the Argentine ecumenical group Renewal Communion of Catholics and Evangelicals in the Holy Spirit.

Occasional local disputes still crop up; in Russia, some Orthodox clergy have been less than welcoming to Catholics and Protestants establishing new churches, and in parts of Latin America, Catholic bishops have expressed alarm over the rising popularity of Protestant denominations. But the leaders of the three main Christian groups favor good relations with one another and seek to spread that preference to their congregants.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27Francis' behavior so far indicates a rethinking of the papacy. On the balcony of Saint Peter's Basilica, immediately after his selection, he referred to himself as "bishop of Rome," the most modest papal title. Francis dresses and travels unpretentiously and discouraged peers from spending money to attend his installation. All this reveals a plan to undercut the imperial trappings of the papacy-a goal already respected by other Christian leaders. Francis will certainly uphold Catholic doctrine, but by making Jesus Christ and the gospel the central focus of his pontificate, he will enhance Christian unity as well.

It is the most common cancer among women, next to skin cancers, and is second only to lung cancer in cancer deaths in women. Only 5 to 10 percent of breast cancers occur in women with a clearly defined genetic predisposition for the disease. The overall risk for developing breast cancer increases as a woman gets older.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27Breast cancer can be treated with surgery, radiation and drugs (chemotherapy and hormonal therapy). Doctors may use one of these or a combination, depending on factors such as the type and location of the cancer, whether the disease has spread, and the patient's overall health.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27Most women with breast cancer will have some type of surgery, depending on the stage of the breast cancer. (See "Stages of Breast Cancer.") The least invasive, lumpectomy (breast-conserving surgery), removes only the cancerous tissue and a surrounding margin of normal tissue. Removal of the entire breast is a mastectomy. A modified radical mastectomy includes the entire breast and some of the underarm lymph nodes. The very disfiguring radical mastectomy, in which the breast, lymph nodes, and chest wall muscles under the breast are removed, is rarely performed today because doctors believe that a modified radical mastectomy is just as effective.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27While removing underarm lymph nodes after surgery is important in order to determine if the cancer has spread, this procedure may add chronic arm swelling and restricted shoulder motion to the discomforts of the overall treatment. But a new method, sentinel node biopsy, still under investigation, allows physicians to pinpoint the first lymph node into which a tumor drains (the sentinel node), and remove only the nodes most likely to contain cancer cells.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27To locate the sentinel node, the physician injects a radioactive tracer in the area around the tumor before the mastectomy. The tracer travels the same path to the lymph nodes that cancer cells would take, making it possible for the surgeon to determine the one or two nodes most likely to test positive. The surgeon will then remove the nodes most likely to be cancerous.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27Radiation therapy is treatment with high-energy rays or particles given to destroy cancer. In almost all cases, lumpectomy is followed by six to seven weeks of radiation, an integral part of breast-conserving treatment. Although radiation therapy damages both normal cells and cancerous cells, most of the normal cells are able to repair themselves and function properly.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27Radiation therapy can cause side effects such as swelling and heaviness in the breast, sunburn-like skin changes in the treated area, and lymphedema (swelling of the arm due to fluid buildup) if the underarm lymph nodes were treated after a node dissection.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27Drugs are used to reach cancer cells that may have spread beyond the breastÂ­in many cases even if no cancer is detected in the lymph nodes after surgery. While doctors once believed that the spread of breast cancer could be controlled with extensive surgery, they now believe that cancer cells may break away from the primary tumor and spread through the bloodstream, even in the earliest stages of the disease. These cells cannot be felt by examination or seen on x-rays or other imaging methods, and they cause no symptoms. But they can establish new tumors in other organs or the bones. The goal of drug treatment even if there's no detectable cancer after surgery, known as adjuvant therapy, is to kill these hidden cells. Not every patient, however, needs adjuvant therapy. Doctors will make recommendations regarding specific types of therapy based on the stage of the breast cancer. (See "Stages of Breast Cancer.")

A genetically engineered drug, Herceptin (trastuzumab), binds to HER2 and kills the excess cancer cells, theoretically leaving healthy cells alone.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27Herceptin, made by Genentech Inc., San Francisco, Calif., and approved by FDA in September 1998, is an intravenous treatment that is used alone in patients who have had little success with other drugs, or as a first-line treatment in combination with the drug Taxol (paclitaxel).

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27Recent follow-up research shows that Herceptin also may modestly extend the lives of terminal breast cancer patients. Updated survival figures reported from a two-year study by one of the drug's key developers from the University of California at Los Angeles showed the risk of death to be 16 percent lower in those getting Herceptin. Scientists say that while the improvement is small-about four months on average-it is especially noteworthy in a disease that until now has eluded many efforts to slow its progression to death.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27Selection of patients who are most likely to benefit from Herceptin is important because of the possible serious risks from the drug, including weakening of the heart muscle that can lead to congestive heart failure.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27FDA also approved in September a test called DAKO HercepTest to measure HER2 protein in tumors.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27Nolvadex: A drug that has been used as a breast cancer treatment for more than 20 years, Nolvadex (tamoxifen citrate) was approved by FDA in October 1998 for breast cancer risk reduction in high-risk women.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27Doctors know that estrogen promotes the growth of breast cancer cells. Tamoxifen interferes with the activity of estrogen by slowing or stopping the growth of cancer cells already present in the body. As adjuvant therapy, tamoxifen has been shown to help prevent the original breast cancer from returning, and also the development of new cancers in the other breast.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27An NCI study showed that the drug reduced the chance of getting breast cancer by 44 percent in women who were judged to be at increased risk for the disease. FDA emphasizes, however, that tamoxifen, manufactured by Zeneca Pharmaceutical Inc., Wilmington, Del., will not eliminate breast cancer risk completely, and should be used only following a medical evaluation of individual risk factors.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27Due to potentially serious side effects, including endometrial (lining of the uterus) cancer and blood clots in major veins and the lungs, the American Society of Clinical Oncology recommends that patients talk with their regular health-care providers to determine whether individual medical circumstances and histories are appropriate for considering use of tamoxifen.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27Xeloda: Xeloda (capecitabine), made by Hoffmann-La Roche, was approved by FDA in April 1998 for the treatment of breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body (metastasized) and is resistant to both paclitaxel and an anthracycline-containing regimen. Xeloda does not kill the cancer cells directly. Instead, once the drug enters the cancer cells, it is metabolized to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), a drug routinely used for breast cancer. The advantage of Xeloda, in addition to the convenience of its pill form, is that cancer cells actively convert it to 5-FU, but normal cells convert very little to 5-FU.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27Taxotere: In May 1996, FDA gave accelerated approval to Taxotere (docetaxel) to treat patients whose locally advanced or metastasized breast cancer has progressed despite treatment with other drugs. The approval was conditional on the manufacturer, Rhone-Poulenc Rorer Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Collegeville, Pa., conducting additional studies. In June 1998, after additional studies confirmed its safety and effectiveness, FDA granted full approval.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27Before these newer drugs, a doctor's first line of defense against breast cancer was to use combinations of the anticancer drugs Cytoxan (cyclophosphamide) and Adriamycin (doxorubicin), with or without Adrucil (fluorouracil).

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27Chemotherapy (drug treatment) is given in cycles, with each period of treatment followed by a recovery period. The total course of chemotherapy can last three to six months, depending on the drugs and how far the cancer has spread.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27Kelly Munsell of Tucson, Ariz., took the combination Adriamycin and Cytoxan in six cycles, spaced three weeks apart, after doctors diagnosed her breast cancer in 1996 at age 27.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27"Chemo for me was torture," Munsell recalls, describing profuse vomiting and severe weight gain as two of the serious side effects. But despite the discomfort, Munsell, whose mother and grandmother both died of breast cancer, is glad she underwent the grueling treatment two years ago. "My recent battery of tests came back negative for cancer," she says.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27In addition to the drugs actually battling the disease, there also is help for patients in severe pain from cancer. FDA approved Actiq (oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate) Nov. 5, 1998, as a treatment specifically for cancer patients with severe pain that breaks through their regular narcotic therapy. A narcotic more potent than morphine, Actiq is in the form of a flavored sugar lozenge that dissolves slowly in the mouth. Actiq is approved for patients already taking at least 60 milligrams of morphine per day for their underlying persistent cancer pain.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27It is important for every woman to consider herself at risk for breast cancer, ACS says, simply because she's female. At the same time, however, studies continue to uncover lifestyle factors and habits that can alter that risk, and many new chemotherapy drugs and drug combinations that are being tested in clinical trials. Drugs and procedures currently under investigation include bisphosphonates (a group of drugs routinely used to treat osteoporosis), monoclonal antibodies (similar to Herceptin), and angiogenesis inhibitors (drugs that keep blood vessels that nourish cancer cells from developing).

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27"While death rates from breast cancer are falling, and while there are a number of exciting new strategies being developed," says Michael A. Friedman, M.D., FDA's deputy commissioner for operations and former cancer research specialist, "we recognize that a great deal more needs to be done."

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27The American Cancer Society says that the best strategy for successfully beating breast cancer is to follow guidelines for early detection. Currently, the most effective technique for early detection is screening mammography, an x-ray procedure that can detect small tumors and breast abnormalities up to two years before they can be felt and when they are most treatable. (See "FDA Sets Higher Standards for Mammography" in the January-February 1999 FDA Consumer.)

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27Studies show that regular screening mammograms can help decrease the chance of dying from breast cancer. Finding a breast tumor early may mean that a woman can choose breast-saving surgery. Furthermore, she may not have to undergo chemotherapy.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27Stages of breast cancer, according to the American Cancer Society, indicate the size of a tumor and how far the cancer has spread within the breast, to nearby tissues, and to other organs. Specific treatment is most often determined by the following stages of the disease:

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27Carcinoma In Situ: Cancer is confined to the lobules (milk-producing glands) or ducts (passages connecting milk-producing glands to the nipple) and has not invaded nearby breast tissue.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27Stage I: Tumor is smaller than or equal to 2 centimeters in diameter and underarm (axillary) lymph nodes test negative for cancer.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27Stage II: Tumor is larger than 2 centimeters in diameter with negative lymph nodes, or tumor is less than or equal to 5 centimeters with positive lymph nodes.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27Stage III: This stage is divided into substages known as IIIA and IIIB:

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27* IIIA: Tumor is larger than 5 centimeters with positive lymph nodes, or tumor is any size with lymph nodes that adhere to one another or surrounding tissue.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27* IIIB: Tumor of any size has spread to the skin, chest wall, or internal mammary lymph nodes (located beneath the breast and inside the chest).

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27Stage IV: Tumor, regardless of size, has metastasized (spread) to distant sites such as bones, lungs, or lymph nodes not near the breast.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27During the 1990s, home-testing kits came into their own. Screening tests for hepatitis C, cholesterol, illegal drugs, and, of course, pregnancy, are now on the market. Consumers also can test at home for HIV-1, the virus that causes AIDS. But only one such kit is approvedÂ­the Home Access Express HIV-1 Test System. Other test systems promoted on the Internet and through print promotions are not approved, though they sometimes claim approval falsely. You can read all about these bogus tests on www.fda.gov/cber/infosheets/hiv-home2.htm. Included is the "Lei-Home Access HIV Test," which landed a businessman in jail for five years for selling the useless kits. (For the full story on these bogus kits, see "Investigators' Reports" in this issue.)

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27An estimated 129,400 Americans will be diagnosed with colon cancer this year, and 56,000 will die. But many of these deaths could be prevented if consumers aged 50 and older would get a simple screening test that can detect small growths in the colon before they become malignant and deadly. To help consumers understand colon cancer, a Website sponsored by the national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention explains how men and women can reduce their risk of dying from this disease by early detection. The site has artwork showing where the colon is and explains the two most common screening tests: blood stool tests and physician exams of the rectum and lower colon. The Website, www.cdc.gov/cancer/screenforlife/, is part of a massive campaign by CDC, the Health Care Financing Administration, and the National Cancer Institute to educate consumers about preventing the disease.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27Two different women. The same deadly disease. One thought she couldn't get it. The other was told she didn't have it. Both opinions were wrong.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27In 1994, one week before turning 35, Cathy Young received the devastating news. "I thought people had to be in their 50s to get cancer," the Oak Grove, Mo., resident says. "And then it happened to me."

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27Linda Hunter, 42, recalls that in January 1995, her mammogram results came back normal. But skin changes on one of her breasts compelled her to seek a second, third and fourth opinionÂ­all of which supported the initial mammogram findings. Her tenacity finally paid off when a fifth doctor she visited detected a rare form of the disease.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27Every three minutes a woman in the United States learns she has breast cancer. It is the most common cancer among women, next to skin cancers, and is second only to lung cancer in cancer deaths in women. Only 5 to 10 percent of breast cancers occur in women with a clearly defined genetic predisposition for the disease. The overall risk for developing breast cancer increases as a woman gets older.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27Although treatment is initially successful for many women, the American Cancer Society (ACS) says that breast cancer will return in about 50 percent of these cases.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27"It's hard to say that things are back to normal when one survives breast cancer," says Young, "because a survivor always has a fear that one day the cancer may return."

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27New drugs, treatment regimens, and better diagnostic techniques have improved the outlook for many, and are responsible, according to ACS, for breast cancer death rates going down.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27"Women have greater options in breast cancer treatment compared to a decade ago," says Harman Eyre, M.D., chief medical officer for ACS. "New drugs and procedures open up a whole new era of effective treatment."

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27Breast cancer can be treated with surgery, radiation and drugs (chemotherapy and hormonal therapy). Doctors may use one of these or a combination, depending on factors such as the type and location of the cancer, whether the disease has spread, and the patient's overall health.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27Most women with breast cancer will have some type of surgery, depending on the stage of the breast cancer. (See "Stages of Breast Cancer.") The least invasive, lumpectomy (breast-conserving surgery), removes only the cancerous tissue and a surrounding margin of normal tissue. Removal of the entire breast is a mastectomy. A modified radical mastectomy includes the entire breast and some of the underarm lymph nodes. The very disfiguring radical mastectomy, in which the breast, lymph nodes, and chest wall muscles under the breast are removed, is rarely performed today because doctors believe that a modified radical mastectomy is just as effective.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27While removing underarm lymph nodes after surgery is important in order to determine if the cancer has spread, this procedure may add chronic arm swelling and restricted shoulder motion to the discomforts of the overall treatment. But a new method, sentinel node biopsy, still under investigation, allows physicians to pinpoint the first lymph node into which a tumor drains (the sentinel node), and remove only the nodes most likely to contain cancer cells.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27To locate the sentinel node, the physician injects a radioactive tracer in the area around the tumor before the mastectomy. The tracer travels the same path to the lymph nodes that cancer cells would take, making it possible for the surgeon to determine the one or two nodes most likely to test positive. The surgeon will then remove the nodes most likely to be cancerous.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27Radiation therapy is treatment with high-energy rays or particles given to destroy cancer. In almost all cases, lumpectomy is followed by six to seven weeks of radiation, an integral part of breast-conserving treatment. Although radiation therapy damages both normal cells and cancerous cells, most of the normal cells are able to repair themselves and function properly.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27Radiation therapy can cause side effects such as swelling and heaviness in the breast, sunburn-like skin changes in the treated area, and lymphedema (swelling of the arm due to fluid buildup) if the underarm lymph nodes were treated after a node dissection.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27Drugs are used to reach cancer cells that may have spread beyond the breastÂ­in many cases even if no cancer is detected in the lymph nodes after surgery. While doctors once believed that the spread of breast cancer could be controlled with extensive surgery, they now believe that cancer cells may break away from the primary tumor and spread through the bloodstream, even in the earliest stages of the disease. These cells cannot be felt by examination or seen on x-rays or other imaging methods, and they cause no symptoms. But they can establish new tumors in other organs or the bones. The goal of drug treatment even if there's no detectable cancer after surgery, known as adjuvant therapy, is to kill these hidden cells. Not every patient, however, needs adjuvant therapy. Doctors will make recommendations regarding specific types of therapy based on the stage of the breast cancer. (See "Stages of Breast Cancer.")

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27FDA has approved several new drugs and new uses for older drugs in the past year that improve the chances of successfully treating breast cancer. These drugs include:

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27Herceptin: About 30 percent of women with breast cancer have an excess of a protein called HER2, which makes tumors grow quickly. A genetically engineered drug, Herceptin (trastuzumab), binds to HER2 and kills the excess cancer cells, theoretically leaving healthy cells alone.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27Herceptin, made by Genentech Inc., San Francisco, Calif., and approved by FDA in September 1998, is an intravenous treatment that is used alone in patients who have had little success with other drugs, or as a first-line treatment in combination with the drug Taxol (paclitaxel).

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27Recent follow-up research shows that Herceptin also may modestly extend the lives of terminal breast cancer patients. Updated survival figures reported from a two-year study by one of the drug's key developers from the University of California at Los Angeles showed the risk of death to be 16 percent lower in those getting Herceptin. Scientists say that while the improvement is small-about four months on average-it is especially noteworthy in a disease that until now has eluded many efforts to slow its progression to death.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27Selection of patients who are most likely to benefit from Herceptin is important because of the possible serious risks from the drug, including weakening of the heart muscle that can lead to congestive heart failure.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27FDA also approved in September a test called DAKO HercepTest to measure HER2 protein in tumors.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27Nolvadex: A drug that has been used as a breast cancer treatment for more than 20 years, Nolvadex (tamoxifen citrate) was approved by FDA in October 1998 for breast cancer risk reduction in high-risk women.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27Doctors know that estrogen promotes the growth of breast cancer cells. Tamoxifen interferes with the activity of estrogen by slowing or stopping the growth of cancer cells already present in the body. As adjuvant therapy, tamoxifen has been shown to help prevent the original breast cancer from returning, and also the development of new cancers in the other breast.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27An NCI study showed that the drug reduced the chance of getting breast cancer by 44 percent in women who were judged to be at increased risk for the disease. FDA emphasizes, however, that tamoxifen, manufactured by Zeneca Pharmaceutical Inc., Wilmington, Del., will not eliminate breast cancer risk completely, and should be used only following a medical evaluation of individual risk factors.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27Due to potentially serious side effects, including endometrial (lining of the uterus) cancer and blood clots in major veins and the lungs, the American Society of Clinical Oncology recommends that patients talk with their regular health-care providers to determine whether individual medical circumstances and histories are appropriate for considering use of tamoxifen.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27Xeloda: Xeloda (capecitabine), made by Hoffmann-La Roche, was approved by FDA in April 1998 for the treatment of breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body (metastasized) and is resistant to both paclitaxel and an anthracycline-containing regimen. Xeloda does not kill the cancer cells directly. Instead, once the drug enters the cancer cells, it is metabolized to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), a drug routinely used for breast cancer. The advantage of Xeloda, in addition to the convenience of its pill form, is that cancer cells actively convert it to 5-FU, but normal cells convert very little to 5-FU.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27Taxotere: In May 1996, FDA gave accelerated approval to Taxotere (docetaxel) to treat patients whose locally advanced or metastasized breast cancer has progressed despite treatment with other drugs. The approval was conditional on the manufacturer, Rhone-Poulenc Rorer Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Collegeville, Pa., conducting additional studies. In June 1998, after additional studies confirmed its safety and effectiveness, FDA granted full approval.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27Before these newer drugs, a doctor's first line of defense against breast cancer was to use combinations of the anticancer drugs Cytoxan (cyclophosphamide) and Adriamycin (doxorubicin), with or without Adrucil (fluorouracil).

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27Chemotherapy (drug treatment) is given in cycles, with each period of treatment followed by a recovery period. The total course of chemotherapy can last three to six months, depending on the drugs and how far the cancer has spread.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27Kelly Munsell of Tucson, Ariz., took the combination Adriamycin and Cytoxan in six cycles, spaced three weeks apart, after doctors diagnosed her breast cancer in 1996 at age 27.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27"Chemo for me was torture," Munsell recalls, describing profuse vomiting and severe weight gain as two of the serious side effects. But despite the discomfort, Munsell, whose mother and grandmother both died of breast cancer, is glad she underwent the grueling treatment two years ago. "My recent battery of tests came back negative for cancer," she says.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27In addition to the drugs actually battling the disease, there also is help for patients in severe pain from cancer. FDA approved Actiq (oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate) Nov. 5, 1998, as a treatment specifically for cancer patients with severe pain that breaks through their regular narcotic therapy. A narcotic more potent than morphine, Actiq is in the form of a flavored sugar lozenge that dissolves slowly in the mouth. Actiq is approved for patients already taking at least 60 milligrams of morphine per day for their underlying persistent cancer pain.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27It is important for every woman to consider herself at risk for breast cancer, ACS says, simply because she's female. At the same time, however, studies continue to uncover lifestyle factors and habits that can alter that risk, and many new chemotherapy drugs and drug combinations that are being tested in clinical trials. Drugs and procedures currently under investigation include bisphosphonates (a group of drugs routinely used to treat osteoporosis), monoclonal antibodies (similar to Herceptin), and angiogenesis inhibitors (drugs that keep blood vessels that nourish cancer cells from developing).

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27"While death rates from breast cancer are falling, and while there are a number of exciting new strategies being developed," says Michael A. Friedman, M.D., FDA's deputy commissioner for operations and former cancer research specialist, "we recognize that a great deal more needs to be done."

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27The American Cancer Society says that the best strategy for successfully beating breast cancer is to follow guidelines for early detection. Currently, the most effective technique for early detection is screening mammography, an x-ray procedure that can detect small tumors and breast abnormalities up to two years before they can be felt and when they are most treatable. (See "FDA Sets Higher Standards for Mammography" in the January-February 1999 FDA Consumer.)

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27Studies show that regular screening mammograms can help decrease the chance of dying from breast cancer. Finding a breast tumor early may mean that a woman can choose breast-saving surgery. Furthermore, she may not have to undergo chemotherapy.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27Stages of breast cancer, according to the American Cancer Society, indicate the size of a tumor and how far the cancer has spread within the breast, to nearby tissues, and to other organs. Specific treatment is most often determined by the following stages of the disease:

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27Carcinoma In Situ: Cancer is confined to the lobules (milk-producing glands) or ducts (passages connecting milk-producing glands to the nipple) and has not invaded nearby breast tissue.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27Stage I: Tumor is smaller than or equal to 2 centimeters in diameter and underarm (axillary) lymph nodes test negative for cancer.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27Stage II: Tumor is larger than 2 centimeters in diameter with negative lymph nodes, or tumor is less than or equal to 5 centimeters with positive lymph nodes.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27Stage III: This stage is divided into substages known as IIIA and IIIB:

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27* IIIA: Tumor is larger than 5 centimeters with positive lymph nodes, or tumor is any size with lymph nodes that adhere to one another or surrounding tissue.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27* IIIB: Tumor of any size has spread to the skin, chest wall, or internal mammary lymph nodes (located beneath the breast and inside the chest).

Most of those listed have toll-free numbers, and many have Websites. Included on www.fda.gov/oashi/cancer/trials.html are the National Cancer Institute, which offers access to clinical trials for more than 100 types of cancer, and renowned treatment centers such as the Mayo Clinic and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27During the 1990s, home-testing kits came into their own. Screening tests for hepatitis C, cholesterol, illegal drugs, and, of course, pregnancy, are now on the market. Consumers also can test at home for HIV-1, the virus that causes AIDS. But only one such kit is approvedÂ­the Home Access Express HIV-1 Test System. Other test systems promoted on the Internet and through print promotions are not approved, though they sometimes claim approval falsely. You can read all about these bogus tests on www.fda.gov/cber/infosheets/hiv-home2.htm. Included is the "Lei-Home Access HIV Test," which landed a businessman in jail for five years for selling the useless kits. (For the full story on these bogus kits, see "Investigators' Reports" in this issue.)

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27The federal government offers many programs designed to help senior citizens maintain good health. But these are spread across many agenciesÂ­such as FDA, the National Institute on Aging, the Health Care Financing Administration, even the Veterans AdministrationÂ­so finding the information might be confusing. Now a Website called Access America for Seniors (www.seniors.gov) brings federal health information for older Americans together in one spot. Information on senior health issues, insurance, food assistance, nursing homes, and hospitalization is available at a click. The Social Security Administration hosts the site, which also includes information for seniors on taxes, volunteer activities, travel, and educational opportunities.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27An estimated 129,400 Americans will be diagnosed with colon cancer this year, and 56,000 will die. But many of these deaths could be prevented if consumers aged 50 and older would get a simple screening test that can detect small growths in the colon before they become malignant and deadly. To help consumers understand colon cancer, a Website sponsored by the national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention explains how men and women can reduce their risk of dying from this disease by early detection. The site has artwork showing where the colon is and explains the two most common screening tests: blood stool tests and physician exams of the rectum and lower colon. The Website, www.cdc.gov/cancer/screenforlife/, is part of a massive campaign by CDC, the Health Care Financing Administration, and the National Cancer Institute to educate consumers about preventing the disease.

On countless Web sites and in counter-culture journals, we read this sort of thing: "If modern medicine is so good, why can't we cure cancer?

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-27 Perhaps the most important point to understand is that cancer isn't ONE disease. "Cancer" (Latin for "crab") covers many, many diseases.

Recently, researchers have identified a host of mechanisms that are proving useful in arresting some types of lung cancer. Real treatments are beginning. In the past couple of years, there have been some really promising trials in treatment of melanoma, and as we understand more about how cancers work, we'll be able to attack them sooner and more effectively.

In stories and in science museums, no creature has ever appeared as vicious or fearsome. Maybe that's why we refuse to believe that this dinosaur had more than a few weak spots. Until I started doing some research, I had no idea that dinosaurs often suffered from broken bones, scratched at parasites, and fought off infections.

She is the most complete Tyrannosaurus fossil ever found, as well as one of the largest, and her battered skeleton tells us life was hard in the Cretaceous era. She's on display at the Field Museum in Chicago. I saw her closer to my home, when a copy of Sue was reassembled at the Museum of Idaho as part of a traveling exhibit.

It's easy to look at a dinosaur skeleton without really seeing it, the same way |X)u might look at a whole building and overlook the small details. There are subtle clues hidden in the awesome architecture of dinosaur skeletons-bumps, knobs, and muscle scars-that together tell us about the creature's life.

Several of Sue's ribs were broken, as well as the dinosaur's right upper arm bone and shoulder. The damage on her right side probably came from a single traumatic event, he reasoned. Fractured ribs on the dinosaur's left side, too, hinted that broken bones were just part of life for a successful T. rex. And infections had left their mark in other parts of Sue's skeleton, such as her left calf and two of her vertebrae.

Grotesque lumps of bone showed where breaks had healed or the dinosaur's body had fought off infection. But most impressive of all were those jaw wounds. Both sides of Sue's lower jaw are shot through with large, smooth holes.

His guess fit with the pattern other pale-ontologists had found in tyrannosaurs (a group of species that includes T. rex). Looking at dinosaur head wounds, scientists had figured out that large, predatory dinosaurs often fought by biting each other on the face. Certain fossils of the tyrannosaurs Alberto sauras, Gorgosaurus, and Daspletosaurus had bite wounds on their skulls that could only have come from another tyrannosaur. It wasn't a stretch to think that Tyrannosaurus rex did the same thing. The holes in Sue's lower jaw didn't show any sign of healing; could this mean that the mighty dinosaur was attacked and killed by a rival?

As Brochu and other paleontologists examined Sue's jaw injuries, they realized that the spacing and shape of the holes didn't match a tyrannosaurs teeth. The injuries weren't what scientists would expect from the crushing bite of another huge dinosaur. The question of who killed Sue was reopened. Paleontologists now blame a life form much, much smaller than any dinosaur.

They announced that Sue and her fellow tyrannosaurs were infected by a microorganism that commonly lives in the mouths and throats of modern hawks. In living birds, the microscopic pest is called Trichomonas gallinae. Raptors can catch it by preying on pigeons that have picked up the bug from contaminated water. There are various strains of the bug; some of them cause no symptoms, but others eat away at a bird's lower jaw, damaging the bone and soft tissue. In the most severe cases, the damage is so bad that birds can no longer eat or drink properly.

The damage to her bones and tissues must have made her feasts, which were normally enjoyable (or so I'd like to imagine), so painful and difficult that Sue simply starved to death. The most fearsome carnivore of all time was brought to its knees by an even more vicious predator so small that it can't be seen with the naked eye.

Thanks to puncture wounds on the snout of a young T. rex nicknamed Jane, as well as other specimens, we know that tyrannosaurs bit each other on the face when they tussled. And, if the attacking tyrannosaur had a mouth full of parasites, this would be a great way to transmit the disease. The dinosaur's coarsely serrated teeth made cozy homes for microscopic bugs, which fed on tidbits of leftover meat from dinosaur dinners. Such dirty teeth would have driven deadly microorganisms deep into the heads of other tyrannosaurs.

Of the many T. rex specimens collected so far, at least four have bite marks from another large, carnivorous dinosaur. The details of these fossils show that the tooth marks were made after death. This means the biting dinosaurs were feeding, not fighting. In the region of Montana where we've found Tyrannosaurus remains, there was only one predator big and powerful enough to do such damage- and that's T. rex itself.

Their damage can't always be seen on the bones, like it can with Sue's injured jaws. For the most part, parasites lived in the soft parts of dinosaurs' bodies. When their host's body decayed, the parasites disappeared too. But a few unusual fossils show us that dinosaurs provided homes for a wide range of parasites.

And the turds left behind by sauropods (large, vegetarian dinosaurs) have helped paleontologists learn about what grasses and other plants were alive at the time and how they evolved.

The prehistoric parasites weren't identical to today's species, but they were similar enough to be identified. The little hitchhikers hadn't changed very much in 125 million years.

For the most part, paleontologists who study ancient diseases have focused on injuries they can see directly in dinosaur bones, like Sue's.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/103/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28* Patients and Methods: A total of 447 patients who completed the MMPI between 1962 and 1965 as self-referred general medical outpatients and also completed the SF-36 thirty years later compose the current study sample. The associations between the scores on the SF-36 and the MMPI PSM scale were evaluated by analysis of variance and linear regression analysis.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/103/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28Seligman's theory of explanatory style (ES), a cognitive personality variable, was introduced in the reformulation of the learned helplessness theory to explain individual differences in response to "bad" events.1,2 According to Seligman,3 there are 3 dimensions in ES: internality ("it's me") vs externality, stability ("it's going to last forever") vs instability, and globality ("it's going to undermine everything") vs specificity. During the past 25 years, studies have shown that individuals who profess pessimistic explanations for life events have poorer physical health,4,5 are prone to depression,6 have a less adequately functioning immune system,7,8 and are more frequent users of the medical and mental health care delivery systems.9 In contrast, an optimistic ES has been shown to be beneficial in preventing the development of coronary heart disease and depression and was associated with less use of medical care.10,11

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/103/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28The Optimism-Pessimism (PSM) scale12 of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) developed in 1994 is rooted in Seligman's theory of ES. Two previous studies showed that a pessimistic ES, as measured by the PSM scale, was related to the genesis of depression in patients being evaluated for surgical treatment of intractable temporal lobe epilepsy13 and was a risk factor for Alzheimer disease.14 In our previous study15 of ES and mortality, we reported that a 10-point T-score increase on the PSM scale increases the risk of mortality by 19%; more specifically, the optimists in that study lived longer than the pessimists (P<.002). This association may be expressed as the relative risk (RR) of mortality among the 3 classes of ES (see "Patients and Methods" section for details of our ES classification). In that study, patients classified as having an optimistic ES had a significantly decreased risk of death (RR, 0.50; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.29-0.87; P=.01) compared with those in the group that had a mixed ES. Patients with a pessimistic ES had a similar risk of death (RR, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.88-1.67; P=.24) compared with those in the mixed ES group. These values were adjusted for age, sex, and expected survival. This article, the second in a series, examines the association between ES using scores from the PSM scale of the MMPI and self-reported health status on the 10 scales of the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36), obtained 30 years later.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/103/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28The study group was selected from a series of 1145 consecutive outpatients self-referred to the Mayo Clinic Division of Community Internal Medicine for general medical care from 1962 to 1965. The MMPI was administered to each patient as part of a larger MMPI research study.16 It was not obtained because a Mayo Clinic physician believed that it was clinically indicated. The study was approved by the Mayo Foundation Institutional Review Board.

In 1994, the vital status of the remaining 839 patients was ascertained by reviewing the registration file of the Mayo Clinic, obtaining death certificates, using a mailed questionnaire, or conducting a telephone survey. Of the 523 patients not known to be deceased who were successfully contacted through this process, 447 (85%) completed the SF-36 and constitute the subjects for this study.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/103/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28The 298-item PSM scale of the MMPI (or the PSM-- revised for the MMPI-2(17)) was developed to aid clinicians in identifying patients who have a pessimistic or optimistic outlook on life.12 From Seligman's theory of ES, the Content Analysis of Verbatim Explanation (CAVE) technique was used to develop the scale.12 Specifically, each MMPI item was classified as a "good" or "bad" event (to use Seligman's terms) or was unclassifiable. Almost half of the 550 unique MMPI items (252 of 550) were unclassifiable according to the CAVE technique (eg, "I like mechanics magazines."), whereas 106 items described good events and 192 items described bad events. Duplicate MMPI items were identified and eliminated; in all, 298 items underwent formal evaluation by the CAVE technique.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/103/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28Three experienced judges reviewed all 298 items that could be classified and rated each according to the 3 dimensions of ES (internal or external, stable or unstable, global or specific), using a 7-point Likert scale for each. Mean ratings on each of the 3 causal dimensions were calculated and summed to provide a composite weight for each item. A single bipolar scale (PSM scale) was developed that serves as a primary index of ES. The normalized T-score values were set, following MMPI tradition, to a mean of 50 and an SD of 10. The composite reliability was 0.94.12 High scores indicate pessimism, an ES that attributes bad events to internal, stable, and global causes and conversely attributes good events to external, acute, and specific causes. Low scores on the PSM scale indicate optimism, with the reverse attribution for bad and good events.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/103/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28Thus, the patient's PSM score is the basis for the classification as having a pessimistic, mixed, or optimistic ES. As in our previous study,15 we classified patients as having a pessimistic ES when their PSM score was greater than 60 and as optimistic when their score was less than 40. Patients whose scores were in the 40 to 60 range were classified as having mixed ES, a combination of both optimistic and pessimistic characteristics. These groups correspond to higher than 1 SD above the mean of the reference population, within +/- 1 SD, and lower than I SD below mean. In the absence of other data, we arbitrarily made these cutoff points and labeled the resulting 3 groups as pessimistic, mixed, and optimistic.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/103/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28The SF-36 is a 36-item self-report questionnaire20 that assesses the following 8 health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) concepts as perceived by the patient: physical functioning (10 items), role limitations due to physical problems (4 items), bodily pain (2 items), general health perception (5 items), vitality (4 items), social functioning (2 items), role limitations due to emotional problems (3 items), and mental health (5 items). The 2 summary scores (physical component and mental component) are based on a factor analysis of the 8 scales.21

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/103/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28The 8 SF-36 scales and the summary physical and mental components were scored by using published methods 21 Briefly, for each of the 8 SF-36 concepts, raw item responses were recorded and summed. Each sum was transformed to a 0 to 100 scale, with 0 representing the worst and 100 the best possible health score. To adjust for age and sex differences at the time the SF-36 was completed, scores were standardized relative to the published age- and sex-matched reference norms.20,21 That is, z score deviations for the 8 individual scales and 2 summary scales were calculated by using the means and SDs of the patient's relevant age and sex group. These z scores were then resealed to T scores, with the mean set to 50 and the SD set to 10. Thus, the average HRQoL of the US adult population is represented by a scale score of 50. A self-report of better health is indicated by scores more than 50 and poorer health by scores less than 50.

Pairwise comparisons among ES group means were made by using the least significant difference test. The effect of obtaining higher PSM scores (more pessimistic) on the SF36 domains was quantified by simple linear regression analysis, whereby the change in the SF-36 score was estimated for a 10-unit (1.0 SD) increase in the PSM T score. Also calculated was the Pearson correlation coefficient that quantified the association between PSM scale and the SF36 domains. P <= 05 was considered statistically significant.

During the 1994 contact effort, among those 639 patients not known to be deceased, 74 (67%) of 110 in the optimistic group, 272 (71%) of 385 in the mixed group, and 101 (70%) of 144 in the pessimistic group responded with a completed SF-36 (a total of 447 study patients). The study patients completed the MMPI between July 1962 and March 1965 with a similar date range in the 3 groups. They completed the SF-- 36 between September 1993 and September 1994 with an identical date range in the 3 groups. The optimists were 42% male and the other 2 groups each had 33% male patients (Table 1). The median age of the patients at the completion of the MMPI was in the early 30s and was approximately 60 years when they completed the SF-36.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/103/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28To our knowledge, these are the first 2 studies to report on the long-term health implications of ES assessed by the MMPI PSM scale. Even though it is a retrospective study, the strength of the study includes a cohort study design, a study population of circumscribed geographic location, reasonably high and balanced follow-up, published psychometric properties for the PSM scale and the SF-36, and comparison to population means. It will be challenging to replicate this study in a prospective manner.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/103/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28Our analysis of the survival rate among the 839 medical patients throughout a 30-year period shows that an optimistic ES was associated with a 50% decrease in the risk of mortality (early death) compared with those with a mixed ES. It was our conclusion that ES, as measured by the PSM scale of the MMPI, is significantly associated with mortality; thus, our optimists lived longer than our pessimists. Furthermore, the current study of 447 patients who completed the SF-36 30 years after finishing the MMPI shows that a pessimistic ES, as measured by the PSM scale of the MMPI, is significantly associated with poorer physical and mental health in all 8 of the SF-36 physical and mental health concept domains. Thus, ES, a personality trait as measured by the PSM scale of the MMPI, correlates modestly but significantly with self-reported physical and mental health status 30 years later. More specifically, an optimistic ES is associated with a self-report of fewer limitations due to health; fewer problems with work or other daily activities as a result of physical health; less pain and fewer limitations due to pain and, conversely, better personal health; feeling more energetic most of the time; performing social activities with less interference from physical or emotional problems; fewer problems with work or other daily activities as a result of emotional state; and feeling more peaceful, happier, and calmer most of the time. In short, those with an optimistic ES report their life to be healthier, both mentally and physically, than those with a pessimistic ES. Furthermore, not only do the optimists report a better quality of life than pessimists, the pessimists had mean scores lower than the national average on 5 of the 8 SF-36 scales.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/103/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28Although the exact mechanism of how ES acts as a risk factor for early death or poorer physical and mental health is unclear, several possibilities could be considered. One possibility could be the result of the patient's mental health status; depression and learned helplessness are less likely to develop in optimists. Another possibility could be a result of the patient's attitude toward medical care; optimists might be more positive in seeking and receiving medical help, with fewer tendencies to self-blame and catastrophic thinking. Yet another possibility could be more directly biological (eg, changes in the immune system).

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/103/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28We conclude from our earlier study15 of mortality and the current study of physical and mental health status that optimists report better physical and mental health-related functioning 30 years later and experience better survival. Thus, our study provides documentation for beliefs commonly held by patients and health care practitioners about the importance of optimistic or pessimistic attitudes. As an oncologist colleague said, "These findings by themselves are an extremely powerful statement for those who suffer from serious medical conditions" (E. T. Creagan, MD, oral communication, 2002). However, questions remain about the practical significance of these findings for health care practitioners. Seligman and colleagues3,10,22,23 used cognitive-behavioral interventions for people with a pessimistic ES and showed the efficacy of this intervention on physical health and depression or anxiety end points, with follow-up ranging from 6 months to 3 years. Furthermore, knowledge of a patient's ES, eg, from the PSM or PSM-revised scale, could allow a health care practitioner to adjust the intensity of follow-up management or monitoring to bolster the likelihood of a successful outcome in those situations in which a pessimistic ES has been shown to be associated with poorer success rates. In addition, ES may have implications for prevention, intervention, health care utilization, and compliance with treatment regimens. Well-formulated studies are essential to warrant the extra time, effort, and costs associated with efforts to intervene in a patient's ES or to personalize the care specific to ES. For researchers, particularly those studying end points shown to be related to ES, using ES as a stratification factor in the study design or as an adjusting covariate in the analysis phase would be an obvious application of this information. Information about ES may also help practitioners to understand patients who are prone to noncompliance with treatment regimens, have excess health care utilization, and report lower patient satisfaction with a health care episode.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 An activist's controversial crusade against genetically modified crops. Early this spring, the Indian envi-ronmentalist Vandana Shiva led an unusual pilgrimage across southern Europe. Beginning in Greece, with the international Pan-Hellenic Exchange of Local Seed Varieties Festival, which celebrated the virtues of traditional agriculture, Shiva and an entourage of followers crossed the Adriatic and travelled by bus up the boot of Italy, to Florence, where she spoke at the Seed, Food and Earth Democracy Festival. After a short planning meeting in Genoa, the caravan rolled on to the South of France, ending in Le Mas d'Azil, just in time to celebrate International Days of the Seed. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 Shiva's fiery opposition to globalization and to the use of genetically modified crops has made her a hero to anti-G.M.O. activists everywhere. The purpose of the trip through Europe, she had told me a few weeks earlier, was to focus attention there on "the voices of those who want their agriculture to be free of poison and G.M.O.s." At each stop, Shiva delivered a message that she has honed for nearly three decades: by engineering, patenting, and transforming seeds into costly packets of intellectual property, multinational corporations such as Monsanto, with considerable assistance from the World Bank, the World Trade Organization, the United States government, and even philanthropies like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, are attempting to impose "food totalitarianism" on the world. She describes the fight against agricultural biotechnology as a global war against a few giant seed companies on behalf of the billions of farmers who depend on what they themselves grow to survive. Shiva contends that nothing less than the future of humanity rides on the outcome. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 "There are two trends," she told the crowd that had gathered in Piazza Santissima Annunziata, in Florence, for the seed fair. "One: a trend of diversity, democracy, freedom, joy, culture--people celebrating their lives." She paused to let silence fill the square. "And the other: monocultures, deadness. Everyone depressed. Everyone on Prozac. More and more young people unemployed. We don't want that world of death." The audience, a mixture of people attending the festival and tourists on their way to the Duomo, stood transfixed. Shiva, dressed in a burgundy sari and a shawl the color of rust, was a formidable sight. "We would have no hunger in the world if the seed was in the hands of the farmers and gardeners and the land was in the hands of the farmers," she said. "They want to take that away." 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 Shiva, along with a growing army of supporters, argues that the prevailing model of industrial agriculture, heavily reliant on chemical fertilizers, pesticides, fossil fuels, and a seemingly limitless supply of cheap water, places an unacceptable burden on the Earth's resources. She promotes, as most knowledgeable farmers do, more diversity in crops, greater care for the soil, and more support for people who work the land every day. Shiva has particular contempt for farmers who plant monocultures--vast fields of a single crop. "They are ruining the planet," she told me. "They are destroying this beautiful world." 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 The global food supply is indeed in danger. Feeding the expanding population without further harming the Earth presents one of the greatest challenges of our time, perhaps of all time. By the end of the century, the world may well have to accommodate ten billion inhabitants--roughly the equivalent of adding two new Indias. Sustaining that many people will require farmers to grow more food in the next seventy-five years than has been produced in all of human history. For most of the past ten thousand years, feeding more people simply meant farming more land. That option no longer exists; nearly every arable patch of ground has been cultivated, and irrigation for agriculture already consumes seventy per cent of the Earth's freshwater. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 The nutritional demands of the developing world's rapidly growing middle class--more protein from pork, beef, chicken, and eggs--will add to the pressure; so will the ecological impact of climate change, particularly in India and other countries where farmers depend on monsoons. Many scientists are convinced that we can hope to meet those demands only with help from the advanced tools of plant genetics. Shiva disagrees; she looks upon any seed bred in a laboratory as an abomination. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 The fight has not been easy. Few technologies, not the car, the phone, or even the computer, have been adopted as rapidly and as widely as the products of agricultural biotechnology. Between 1996, when genetically engineered crops were first planted, and last year, the area they cover has increased a hundredfold--from seventeen million hectares to a hundred and seventy million. Nearly half of the world's soybeans and a third of its corn are products of biotechnology. Cotton that has been engineered to repel the devastating bollworm dominates the Indian market, as it does almost everywhere it has been introduced. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 Those statistics have not deterred Shiva. At the age of sixty- one, she is constantly in motion: this year, she has travelled not only across Europe but throughout South Asia, Africa, and Canada, and twice to the United States. In the past quarter century, she has turned out nearly a book a year, including "The Violence of the Green Revolution," "Monocultures of the Mind," "Stolen Harvest," and "Water Wars." In each, she has argued that modern agricultural practices have done little but plunder the Earth.Vandana Shiva accuses multinational corporations such as Monsanto of attempting to impose "food totalitarianism" on the world. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 Nowhere is Shiva embraced more fully than in the West, where, as Bill Moyers recently noted, she has become a "rock star in the worldwide battle against genetically modified seeds." She has been called the Gandhi of grain and compared to Mother Teresa. If she personally accepted all the awards, degrees, and honors offered to her, she would have time for little else. In 1993, Shiva received the Right Livelihood Award, often called the alternative Nobel Prize, for her activism on behalf of ecology and women. Time, the Guardian, Forbes, and Asia Week have all placed her on lists of the world's most important activists. Shiva, who holds a Ph.D. in philosophy from the University of Western Ontario, has received honorary doctorates from universities in Paris, Oslo, and Toronto, among others. In 2010, she was awarded the Sydney Peace Prize for her commitment to social justice and her tireless efforts on behalf of the poor. Earlier this year, Beloit College, in Wisconsin, honored Shiva with its Weissberg Chair in International Studies, calling her "a one-woman movement for peace, sustainability, and social justice."

"Our commitment is to make sure that dictatorship never flourishes." While she spoke, I stood among the volunteers who were selling heirloom vegetable seeds and handing out information about organic farming. Most were Italian college students in for the day from Bologna or Rome, and few could take their eyes off her. I asked a twenty-year-old student named Victoria if she had been aware of Shiva's work. "For years," she said. Then, acknowledging Shiva's undeniable charisma, she added, "I was just in a room with her. I have followed her all my life, but you can't be prepared for her physical presence." She hesitated and glanced at the platform where Shiva was speaking. "Isn't she just magic?"

In 1943 alone, during the final years of the British Raj, more than two million people died in the Bengal Famine. "By the time we became free of colonial rule, the country was sucked dry," Suman Sahai told me recently. Sahai, a geneticist and a prominent environmental activist, is the founder of the Delhi-based Gene Campaign, a farmers'-rights organization. "The British destroyed the agricultural system and made no investments. They wanted food to feed their Army and food to sell overseas. They cared about nothing else." Independence, in 1947, brought euphoria but also desperation. Tons of grain were imported each year from the United States; without it, famine would have been inevitable. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 To become independent in more than name, India also needed to become self-reliant. The Green Revolution--a series of agricultural innovations producing improved varieties of wheat that could respond better to irrigation and benefit from fertilizer--provided that opportunity. In 1966, India imported eleven million tons of grain. Today, it produces more than two hundred million tons, much of it for export. Between 1950 and the end of the twentieth century, the world's grain production rose from seven hundred million tons to 1.9 billion, all on nearly the same amount of land.

"It would have been a different planet, smaller, poorer, and far more agrarian." Adamchack runs an organic farm in Northern California, and has served as the president of California Certified Organic Farmers. His wife, Pamela Ronald, is a professor of plant genetics at the University of California at Davis, and their book "Tomorrow's Table" was among the first to demonstrate the ways in which advanced technologies can combine with traditional farming to help feed the world. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 There is another perspective on the Green Revolution. Shiva believes that it destroyed India's traditional way of life. "Until the 1960s, India was successfully pursuing an agricultural development policy based on strengthening the ecological base of agriculture and the self-reliance of peasants," she writes in "The Violence of the Green Revolution." She told me that, by shifting the focus of farming from variety to productivity, the Green Revolution actually was responsible for killing Indian farmers. Few people accept that analysis, though, and more than one study has concluded that if India had stuck to its traditional farming methods millions would have starved.

Runoff polluted many rivers and lakes, and some of India's best farmland was destroyed. "At first, the Green Revolution was wonderful," Sahai told me. "But, without a lot of water, it could not be sustained, and it should have ended long before it did."

S. Swaminathan has called "an evergreen revolution," one that combines the most advanced science with a clear focus on sustaining the environment. Until recently, these have seemed like separate goals. For thousands of years, people have crossed sexually compatible plants and then chosen among their offspring for what seemed like desirable characteristics (sturdy roots, for example, or resistance to disease). Farmers learned how to make better plants and varieties, but it was a process of trial and error until the middle of the nineteenth century, when Gregor Mendel demonstrated that many of the characteristics of a pea plant were passed from one generation to the next according to predictable rules. That created a new science, genetics, which helped make breeding far more precise. Nearly all the plants we cultivate--corn, wheat, rice, roses, Christmas trees--have been genetically modified through breeding to last longer, look better, taste sweeter, or grow more vigorously in arid soil.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28Genetic engineering takes the process one step further. By inserting genes from one species into another, plant breeders today can select traits with even greater specificity. Bt cotton, for instance, contains genes from a bacterium, Bacillus thuringiensis, that is found naturally in the soil. The bacterium produces a toxin that targets cotton bollworm, a pest that infests millions of acres each year. Twenty-five per cent of the world's insecticides have typically been used on cotton, and many of them are carcinogenic. By engineering part of the bacterium's DNA into a cotton seed, scientists made it possible for the cotton boll to produce its own insecticide. Soon after the pest bites the plant, it dies.

But it has also prompted a rancorous debate over the consequences of that knowledge. Genetically modified products have often been advertised as the best way to slow the impact of climate change, produce greater yields, provide more nutrients in food, and feed the world's poorest people. Most of the transgenic crops on the market today, however, have been designed to meet the needs of industrial farmers and their customers in the West.

And they worry that pollen from genetically engineered crops will drift into the wild, altering plant ecosystems forever. Many people, however, raise an even more fundamental objection: crossing varieties and growing them in fields is one thing, but using a gene gun to fire a bacterium into seeds seems like a violation of the rules of life.

A Brahmin, she was raised in prosperity. Her father was a forestry official for the Indian government; her mother worked as a school inspector in Lahore, and, after Partition, when the city became part of Pakistan, she returned to India. In the nineteen- seventies, Shiva joined a women's movement that was determined to prevent outside logging companies from cutting down forests in the highlands of northern India. Their tactic was simple and, ultimately, successful: they would form a circle and hug the trees. Shiva was, literally, one of the early tree huggers. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 The first time we spoke, in New York, she explained why she became an environmental activist. "I was busy with quantum theory for my doctoral work, so I had no idea what was going on with the Green Revolution," she said. Shiva had studied physics as an undergraduate. We were sitting in a small cafe near the United Nations, where she was about to attend an agricultural forum. She had just stepped off the plane from New Delhi, but she gathered energy as she told her story. "In the late eighties, I went to a conference on biotechnology, on the future of food," she said. "There were no genetically modified organisms then. These people were talking about having to do genetic engineering in order to take patents. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 "They said the most amazing things," she went on. "They said Europe and the U.S. are too small a market. We have to have a global market, and that is why we need an intellectual-property-rights law." That meeting set her on a new trajectory. "I realized they want to patent life, and life is not an invention," she said. "They want to release G.M.O.s without testing, and they want to impose this order worldwide. I decided on the flight back I didn't want that world." She returned to India and started Navdanya, which in Hindi means "nine seeds." According to its mandate, the organization was created to "protect the diversity and integrity of living resources, especially native seed, and to promote organic farming and fair trade." Under Shiva's leadership, Navdanya rapidly evolved into a national movement. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 In contrast to most agricultural ecologists, Shiva remains committed to the idea that organic farming can feed the world. Owing almost wholly to the efforts of Shiva and other activists, India has not approved a single genetically modified food crop for human consumption. Only four African nations--South Africa, Burkina Faso, Egypt, and Sudan--permit the commercial use of products that contain G.M.O.s. Europe remains the epicenter of anti-G.M.O. advocacy, but recent polls show that the vast majority of Americans, ever more focussed on the connection between food, farming, and their health, favor mandatory labelling for products that are made with genetically modified ingredients. Most say they would use such labels to avoid eating those foods. For her part, Shiva insists that the only acceptable path is to return to the principles and practices of an earlier era. "Fertilizer should never have been allowed in agriculture," she said in a 2011 speech. "I think it's time to ban it. It's a weapon of mass destruction. Its use is like war, because it came from war." 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 Like Gandhi, whom she reveres, Shiva questions many of the goals of contemporary civilization. Last year, Prince Charles, who keeps a bust of Shiva on display at Highgrove, his family house, visited her at the Navdanya farm, in Dehradun, about a hundred and fifty miles north of New Delhi. Charles, perhaps the world's best-known critic of modern life, has for years denounced transgenic crops. "This kind of genetic modification takes mankind into realms that belong to God and God alone," he wrote in the nineteen-nineties, when Monsanto tried to sell its genetically engineered seeds in Europe. Shiva, too, invokes religion in her assault on agricultural biotechnology. "G.M.O. stands for 'God, Move Over,' we are the creators now," she said in a speech earlier this year. Navdanya does not report its contributions publicly, but, according to a recent Indian government report, foreign N.G.O.s have contributed significantly in the past decade to help the campaign against adoption of G.M.O.s in India. In June, the government banned most such contributions. Shiva, who was named in the report, called it "an attack on civil society," and biased in favor of foreign corporations. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 Shiva maintains a savvy presence in social media, and her tweets, intense and dramatic, circulate rapidly among tens of thousands of followers across the globe. They also allow her to police the movement and ostracize defectors. The British environmentalist Mark Lynas, for example, stood strongly against the use of biotechnology in agriculture for more than a decade. But last year, after careful study of the scientific data on which his assumptions were based, he reversed his position. In a speech to the annual Oxford Farming Conference, he described as "green urban myths" his former view that genetically modified crops increase reliance on chemicals, pose dangers to the environment, and threaten human health. "For the record, here and up front, I apologize for having spent several years ripping up G.M. crops," he said. "I am also sorry that I . . . assisted in demonizing an important technological option which can be used to benefit the environment." Lynas now regards the assumption that the world could be fed solely with organic food as "simplistic nonsense."

"If you want to get your name splattered all over the Web, there's nothing like recanting your once strongly held beliefs," Jason Mark, the editor of Earth Island Journal, wrote. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 Perhaps nobody was more incensed by Lynas's conversion than Shiva, who expressed her anger on Twitter: "#MarkLynas saying farmers shd be free to grow #GMOs which can contaminate #organic farms is like saying #rapists shd have freedom to rape." The message caused immediate outrage. "Shame on you for comparing GMOs to rape," Karl Haro von Mogel, who runs Biology Fortified, a Web site devoted to plant genetics, responded, also in a tweet. "That is a despicable argument that devalues women, men, and children." Shiva tweeted back at once. "We need to move from a patriarchal, anthropocentric worldview to one based on #EarthDemocracy," she wrote. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 Shiva has a flair for incendiary analogies. Recently, she compared what she calls "seed slavery," inflicted upon the world by the forces of globalization, to human slavery. "When starting to fight for seed freedom, it's because I saw a parallel," she said at a food conference in the Netherlands. "That time, it was blacks who were captured in Africa and taken to work on the cotton and sugarcane fields of America. Today, it is all of life being enslaved. All of life. All species." 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 Shiva cannot tolerate any group that endorses the use of genetic engineering in agriculture, no matter what else the organization does, or how qualified its support. When I mentioned that Monsanto, in addition to making genetically engineered seeds, has also become one of the world's largest producers of conventionally bred seeds, she laughed. "That's just public relations," she said. She has a similarly low regard for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which has taken strong positions in support of biotechnology. Not long ago, Shiva wrote that the billions of dollars the foundation has invested in agricultural research and assistance poses "the greatest threat to farmers in the developing world." She dismisses the American scientific organizations responsible for regulating genetically modified products, including the Food and Drug Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the United States Department of Agriculture, as little more than tools of the international seed conglomerates. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 At times, Shiva's absolutism about G.M.O.s can lead her in strange directions. In 1999, ten thousand people were killed and millions were left homeless when a cyclone hit India's eastern coastal state of Orissa. When the U.S. government dispatched grain and soy to help feed the desperate victims, Shiva held a news conference in New Delhi and said that the donation was proof that "the United States has been using the Orissa victims as guinea pigs" for genetically engineered products. She also wrote to the international relief agency Oxfam to say that she hoped it wasn't planning to send genetically modified foods to feed the starving survivors. When neither the U.S. nor Oxfam altered its plans, she condemned the Indian government for accepting the provisions. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 On March 29th, in Winnipeg, Shiva began a speech to a local food- rights group by revealing alarming new information about the impact of agricultural biotechnology on human health. "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said that in two years the figure of autism has jumped from one in eighty-eight to one in sixty- eight," she said, referring to an article in USA Today. "Then they go on to say obviously this is a trend showing that something's wrong, and that whether something in the environment could be causing the uptick remains the million-dollar question. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 "That question's been answered," Shiva continued. She mentioned glyphosate, the Monsanto herbicide that is commonly used with modified crops. "If you look at the graph of the growth of G.M.O.s, the growth of application of glyphosate and autism, it's literally a one-to-one correspondence. And you could make that graph for kidney failure, you could make that graph for diabetes, you could make that graph even for Alzheimer's." 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 Hundreds of millions of people, in twenty-eight countries, eat transgenic products every day, and if any of Shiva's assertions were true the implications would be catastrophic. But no relationship between glyphosate and the diseases that Shiva mentioned has been discovered. Her claims were based on a single research paper, released last year, in a journal called Entropy, which charges scientists to publish their findings. The paper contains no new research. Shiva had committed a common, but dangerous, fallacy: confusing a correlation with causation. (It turns out, for example, that the growth in sales of organic produce in the past decade matches the rise of autism, almost exactly. For that matter, so does the rise in sales of high-definition televisions, as well as the number of Americans who commute to work every day by bicycle.) 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 Shiva refers to her scientific credentials in almost every appearance, yet she often dispenses with the conventions of scientific inquiry. She is usually described in interviews and on television as a nuclear physicist, a quantum physicist, or a world- renowned physicist. Most of her book jackets include the following biographical note: "Before becoming an activist, Vandana Shiva was one of India's leading physicists." When I asked if she had ever worked as a physicist, she suggested that I search for the answer on Google. I found nothing, and she doesn't list any such position in her biography. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 Shiva argues that because many varieties of corn, soybeans, and canola have been engineered to resist glyphosate, there has been an increase in the use of herbicides. That is certainly true, and in high enough amounts glyphosate, like other herbicides, is toxic. Moreover, whenever farmers rely too heavily on one chemical, whether it occurs naturally or is made in a factory, weeds develop resistance. In some regions, that has already happened with glyphosate--and the results can be disastrous. But farmers face the problem whether or not they plant genetically modified crops. Scores of weed species have become resistant to the herbicide atrazine, for example, even though no crops have been modified to tolerate it. In fact, glyphosate has become the most popular herbicide in the world, largely because it's not nearly so toxic as those which it generally replaces. The E.P.A. has labelled water unsafe to drink if it contains three parts per billion of atrazine; the comparable limit for glyphosate is seven hundred parts per billion. By this measure, glyphosate is two hundred and thirty times less toxic than atrazine.

But since 1996, when the crops were first planted, humans have consumed trillions of servings of foods that contain genetically engineered ingredients, and have draped themselves in thousands of tons of clothing made from genetically engineered cotton, yet there has not been a single documented case of any person becoming ill as a result. That is one reason that the National Academy of Sciences, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the World Health Organization, the U.K.'s Royal Society, the French Academy of Sciences, the European Commission, and dozens of other scientific organizations have all concluded that foods derived from genetically modified crops are as safe to eat as any other food.

"Truth be damned. People in the rich world love to dabble in a past they were lucky enough to avoid--you know, a couple of chickens running around with the children in the back yard. But farming is bloody tough, as anyone who does it knows. It is like those people who romanticize villages in the developing world. Nobody who ever lived in one would do that."

I drove east from Auran-gabad on rutted roadways, where the contradictions of modern India are always on display: bright-green pyramids of sweet limes, along with wooden trinkets, jewelry salesmen, cell-phone stands, and elaborately decorated water delivery trucks. Behind the stands were giant, newly constructed houses, all safely tucked away in gated communities. Regional power companies in that part of the country pay two rupees (about three cents) a kilogram for discarded cotton stalks, and, as I drove past, the fields were full of women pulling them out of the ground. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 Although India bans genetically modified food crops, Bt cotton, modified to resist the bollworm, is planted widely. Since the nineteen-nineties, Shiva has focussed the world's attention on Maharashtra by referring to the region as India's "suicide belt," and saying that Monsanto's introduction of genetically modified cotton there has caused a "genocide." There is no place where the battle over the value, safety, ecological impact, and economic implications of genetically engineered products has been fought more fiercely. Shiva says that two hundred and eighty-four thousand Indian farmers have killed themselves because they cannot afford to plant Bt cotton. Earlier this year, she said, "Farmers are dying because Monsanto is making profits--by owning life that it never created but it pretends to create. That is why we need to reclaim the seed. That is why we need to get rid of the G.M.O.s. That is why we need to stop the patenting of life."

She seemed to know that, but said that the only way I could understand the scale of the disaster would be to visit the region myself. She also proposed that I join the seed caravan in Europe and then travel with her to the Navdanya farm. We exchanged several logistical texts and e-mails, but by the time I got to Italy Shiva had stopped writing or responding to my messages. In Florence, where she spoke to me briefly as she walked to a meeting, she said that I could try to see her in New Delhi but she doubted that she would be free. When I arrived in India, one of her assistants told me that I should submit any questions in writing. I did, but Shiva declined to answer them.

But Bt cotton has been planted by millions of people in the developing world, many of whom maintain lots not much larger than the back yard of a house in the American suburbs. In India, more than seven million farmers, occupying twenty-six million acres, have adopted the technology. That's nearly ninety per cent of all Indian cotton fields. At first, the new seeds were extremely expensive. Counterfeiters flooded the market with fakes and sold them, as well as fake glyphosate, at reduced prices. The crops failed, and many people suffered. Shiva said last year that Bt-cotton-seed costs had risen by eight thousand per cent in India since 2002. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 In fact, the prices of modified seeds, which are regulated by the government, have fallen steadily. While they remain higher than those of conventional seeds, in most cases the modified seeds provide greater benefits. According to the International Food Policy Research Institute, Bt farmers spend at least fifteen per cent more on crops, but their pesticide costs are fifty per cent lower. Since the seed was introduced, yields have increased by more than a hundred and fifty per cent. Only China grows and sells more cotton.

That is not the case in India. The Farmers' Rights Act of 2001 guarantees every person the right to "save, use, sow, resow, exchange, share, or sell" his seeds. Most farmers, though, even those with tiny fields, choose to buy newly bred seeds each year, whether genetically engineered or not, because they insure better yields and bigger profits.

Dhoksal is about three hundred miles northeast of Mumbai, but it seems to belong to another century. It's dusty and tired, and by noon the temperature had passed a hundred degrees. The majority of local farmers travel to the market by bullock cart. Some walk, and a few drive. A week earlier, a local agricultural inspector told me, he had seen a cotton farmer on an elephant and waved to him. The man did not respond, however, because he was too busy talking on his cell phone.

The first thing that the cotton farmers I visited wanted to discuss, though, was their improved health and that of their families. Before Bt genes were inserted into cotton, they would typically spray their crops with powerful chemicals dozens of times each season. Now they spray once a month. Bt is not toxic to humans or to other mammals. Organic farmers, who have strict rules against using synthetic fertilizers or chemicals, have used a spray version of the toxin on their crops for years.

"Before Bt cotton came in, we used the other seeds," Rameshwar Mamdev told me when I stopped by his six-acre farm, not far from the main dirt road that leads to the village. He plants corn in addition to cotton. "My wife would spray," he said. "She would get sick. We would all get sick." According to a recent study by the Flemish Institute for Biotechnology, there has been a sevenfold reduction in the use of pesticide since the introduction of Bt cotton; the number of cases of pesticide poisoning has fallen by nearly ninety per cent. Similar reductions have occurred in China. The growers, particularly women, by reducing their exposure to insecticide, not only have lowered their risk of serious illness but also are able to spend more time with their children.

One concern is that their pollen will drift into the surrounding environment. Pollen does spread, but that doesn't happen so easily; producing new seeds requires a sexually compatible plant. Farmers can reduce the risk of contamination by staggering planting schedules, which insures that different kinds of plants pollinate at different times. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 There is a bigger problem: pests can develop resistance to the toxins in engineered crops. The bollworm isn't Bt cotton's only enemy; the plant has many other pests as well. In the U.S., Bt- cotton farmers are required to use a "refuge" strategy: they surround their Bt crops with a moat of plants that do not make Bt toxins. This forces pests that develop resistance to Bt cotton to mate with pests that have not. In most cases, they will produce offspring that are still susceptible. Natural selection breeds resistance; such tactics only delay the process. But this is true everywhere in nature, not just on farms. Treatments for infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and H.I.V. rely on a cocktail of drugs because the infection would quickly grow resistant to a single medication. Nevertheless, none of the farmers I spoke with in Dhoksal planted a refuge. When I asked why, they had no idea what I was talking about.

In 2011, an American filmmaker, Micha Peled, released "Bitter Seeds," which argues that Monsanto and its seeds have been responsible for the suicides of thousands of farmers. The film received warm recommendations from food activists in the U.S. "Films like this can change the world," the celebrity chef Alice Waters said when she saw it. As the journalist Keith Kloor pointed out earlier this year, in the journal Issues in Science and Technology, the farmer-suicide story even found its way into the scientific community. Last October, at a public discussion devoted to food security, the Stanford biologist Paul Ehrlich stated that Monsanto had "killed most of those farmers in India." Ehrlich also famously predicted, in the nineteen-sixties, that famine would strike India and that, within a decade, "hundreds of millions of people will starve to death." Not only was he wrong but, between 1965 and 1972, India's wheat production doubled.

Although many Indian farmers kill themselves, their suicide rate has not risen in a decade, according to a study by Ian Plewis, of the University of Manchester. In fact, the suicide rate among Indian farmers is lower than for other Indians and is comparable to that among French farmers. Plewis found that "the pattern of changes in suicide rates over the last fifteen years is consistent with a beneficial effect of Bt cotton for India as a whole, albeit perhaps not in every cotton-growing state."

The only commercial farmers in the United States without crop insurance are those who have a philosophical objection to government support. In India, if you fail you are on your own. Farmers all need credit, but banks will rarely lend to them. "We want to send our children to school," Pawar told me. "We want to live better. We want to buy equipment. But when the crop fails we cannot pay." In most cases, there is no choice but to turn to money lenders, and, in villages like Dhoksal, they are often the same people who sell seeds. The annual interest rate on loans can rise to forty per cent, which few farmers anywhere could hope to pay.

Sahai is not ideologically opposed to the use of genetically engineered crops, but she believes that the Indian government regulates them poorly. Nonetheless, she says that the Bt- suicide talk is exaggerated. "If you revoked the permit to plant Bt cotton tomorrow, would that stop suicides on farms?" she said. "It wouldn't make much difference. Studies have shown that unbearable credit and a lack of financial support for agriculture is the killer. It's hardly a secret." 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 It would be presumptuous to generalize about the complex financial realities of India's two hundred and sixty million farmers after having met a dozen of them. But I neither saw nor heard anything that supported Vandana Shiva's theory that Bt cotton has caused an "epidemic" of suicides. "When you call somebody a fraud, that suggests the person knows she is lying," Mark Lynas told me on the phone recently. "I don't think Vandana Shiva necessarily knows that. But she is blinded by her ideology and her political beliefs. That is why she is so effective and so dangerous." Lynas currently advises the Bangladeshi government on trials it is conducting of Bt brinjal (eggplant), a crop that, despite several peer-reviewed approvals, was rejected by the environmental minister in India. Brinjal is the first G.M. food crop in South Asia. Shiva wrote recently that the Bangladeshi project not only will fail but will kill the farmers who participate.

Shiva has repeatedly said that the company should be tried for "ecocide and genocide." When I asked Monsanto's chairman, Hugh Grant, how he dealt with such charges, he looked at me and shook his head, slowly. "We are a science-based company," he said. "I feel very strongly that you need to be grounded in the science or you lose the drift." 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 It was an unusually hot day in St. Louis, where Monsanto has its headquarters, and Grant was in shirtsleeves, rolled halfway up his arm. "Obviously, I am an optimistic Scotsman," he said, in an accent that has been softened by many years in the U.S. "Or I would be doing something else for a living." Grant often stresses the need to develop crops that use less water--and has argued for years that G.M.O.s alone could never feed the world. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 Nonetheless, Monsanto has pursued the market for transgenic crops with a zeal that has sometimes troubled even proponents of the underlying science. "When G.M. technology was in its infancy, many people were concerned," Anne Glover, the chief scientific adviser to the president of the European Commission, said recently. Glover considers it unethical to ignore G.M. crops if other approaches have failed. "People are still concerned about G.M.," she said. "Most of them are uneasy not with the technology per se but, rather, with the business practices in the agrifood sector, which is dominated by multinational companies." She said that those companies need to do a much better job of communicating with their customers. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 Grant concedes the point. "For years, we would have said that we are a biotech company," he said. "We are so far down the food chain . . . we always felt that we were divorced from what ends up on the shelf. And we are not." He noted that, during the past fifty years, the connection between American farmers and their customers had become increasingly tenuous, but that had begun to change. "People may despise us," he said, "but we are all talking about the same issues now, and that is a change I welcome. Food and agriculture are finally part of the conversation." Grant told me that, in 2002, he had commissioned a study to explore the idea of changing the company's name. "It would have cost twenty-five million dollars," he said. "At the time, that seemed like a waste of money." He paused for a moment. "It was my call, and it was a big mistake." 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 The all-encompassing obsession with Monsanto has made rational discussion of the risks and benefits of genetically modified products difficult. Many academic scientists who don't work for Monsanto or any other large corporation are struggling to develop crops that have added nutrients and others that will tolerate drought, floods, or salty soil--all traits needed desperately by the world's poorest farmers. Golden Rice--enriched with vitamin A--is the best-known example. More than a hundred and ninety million children under the age of five suffer from vitamin-A deficiency. Every year, as many as half a million will go blind. Rice plants produce beta carotene, the precursor to vitamin A, in the leaves but not in the grain. To make Golden Rice, scientists insert genes in the edible part of the plant, too. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 Golden Rice would never offer more than a partial solution to micronutrient deficiency, and the intellectual-property rights have long been controlled by the nonprofit International Rice Research Institute, which makes the rights available to researchers at no cost. Still, after more than a decade of opposition, the rice is prohibited everywhere. Two economists, one from Berkeley and the other from Munich, recently examined the impact of that ban. In their study "The Economic Power of the Golden Rice Opposition," they calculated that the absence of Golden Rice in the past decade has caused the loss of at least 1,424,680 life years in India alone. (Earlier this year, vandals destroyed some of the world's first test plots, in the Philippines.)

"In Africa, the pests and diseases of agriculture are as devastating as human diseases," Gordon Conway, who is on the board of the African Agricultural Technology Foundation, told me. He added that the impact of diseases like the fungus black sigatoka, the parasitic weed striga, and the newly identified syndrome maize lethal necrosis- -all of which attack Africa's most important crops--are "in many instances every bit as deadly as H.I.V. and TB." For years, in Tanzania, a disease called brown-streak virus has attacked cassava, a critical source of carbohydrates in the region. Researchers have developed a virus-resistant version of the starchy root vegetable, which is now being tested in field trials. But, again, the opposition, led in part by Shiva, who visited this summer, has been strong. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 Maize is the most commonly grown staple crop in Africa, but it is highly susceptible to drought. Researchers are working on a strain that resists both striga and the African endemic maize-streak virus; there have also been promising advances with insect-resistant cowpea and nutritionally enriched sorghum. Other scientists are working on plants that greatly reduce the need for nitrogen fertilizers, and several that produce healthful omega-3 fatty acids. None of the products have so far managed to overcome regulatory opposition. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 While I was in India, I visited Deepak Pental, the former vice- chancellor of the University of Delhi. Pental, an elegant, soft- spoken man, is a professor of genetics and also one of the country's most distinguished scientists. "We made a mistake in hyper- propagandizing G.M. products, saying it was a technology that would sort out every problem," he began. "The hype has hurt us." Pental, who received his doctorate from Rutgers, has devoted much of his career to research on Brassica juncea, mustard seed. Mustard and canola, Brassica napus, share a common parent. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 Mustard is grown on six million hectares in India. There are parts of the country where farmers raise few other crops. "We have developed a line of mustard oil with a composition that is even better than olive oil," he said. "It has a lot of omega-3 in it, and that is essential for a vegetarian food"--not a minor consideration in a country with half a billion people who eat no meat. The pungency that most people associate with mustard has been bred out of the oil, which is also low in saturated fats. "It is a beautiful, robust system," he said, adding that there have been several successful trials of the mustard seed. "All our work was funded by the public. Nobody will see any profits; that was never our intention. It is a safe, nutritious, and important crop." It also grows well in dry soil. Yet it was made in a laboratory, and, two decades later, the seed remains on the shelf. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 Nearly twenty per cent of the world's population lives in India. But the country has only five per cent of the planet's potable water. "Every time we export one kilogram of basmati rice, we export five thousand kilograms of water," Pental said. "This is a suicidal path. We have no nutritional priorities. We are exporting millions of tons of soy meal to Asia. The Japanese feed it to cows. The nutritive value of what a cow is eating in Japan is more than what a human being eats in India. This has to stop." 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 Pental struggled to keep the disappointment out of his voice. "White rice is the most ridiculous food that human beings can cultivate," he said. "It is just a bunch of starch, and we are filling our bellies with it." He shrugged. "But it's natural," he said, placing ironic emphasis on the final word. "So it passes the Luddite test." 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 In a recent speech, Shiva explained why she rejects studies suggesting that genetically engineered products like Pental's mustard oil are safe. Monsanto, she said, had simply paid for false stories, and "now they control the entire scientific literature of the world." Nature, Science, and Scientific American, three widely admired publications, "have just become extensions of their propaganda. There is no independent science left in the world." 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 Monsanto is certainly rich, but it is simply not that powerful. Exxon Mobil is worth seven times as much as Monsanto, yet it has never been able to alter the scientific consensus that burning fossil fuels is the principal cause of climate change. Tobacco companies spend more money lobbying in Washington each year than Monsanto does, but it's hard to find scientists who endorse smoking. The gulf between the truth about G.M.O.s and what people say about them keeps growing wider. The Internet brims with videos that purport to expose the lies about genetically modified products. Mike Adams, who runs a popular Web site called Natural News, recently compared journalists who are critical of anti-G.M.O. activists such as Shiva to Nazi collaborators. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 The most persistent objection to agricultural biotechnology, and the most common, is that, by cutting DNA from one species and splicing it into another, we have crossed an invisible line and created forms of life unlike anything found in "nature." That fear is unquestionably sincere. Yet, as a walk through any supermarket would demonstrate, nearly every food we eat has been modi-fied, if not by genetic engineering then by more traditional cross-breeding, or by nature itself. Corn in its present form wouldn't exist if humans hadn't cultivated the crop. The plant doesn't grow in the wild and would not survive if we suddenly stopped eating it.

Surgeons routinely suture pig valves into the hearts of humans; the operation has kept tens of thousands of people alive. Synthetic insulin, the first genetically modified product, is consumed each day by millions of diabetics. To make the drug, scientists insert human proteins into a common bacteria, which is then grown in giant industrial vats. Protesters don't march to oppose those advances. In fact, consumers demand them, and it doesn't seem to matter where the replacement parts come from. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 When Shiva writes that "Golden Rice will make the malnutrition crisis worse" and that it will kill people, she reinforces the worst fears of her largely Western audience. Much of what she says resonates with the many people who feel that profit-seeking corporations hold too much power over the food they eat. Theirs is an argument well worth making. But her statements are rarely supported by data, and her positions often seem more like those of an end-of-days mystic than like those of a scientist.

It would be far better if the world's foods contained an adequate supply of vitamins. It would also help the people of many poverty- stricken countries if their governments were less corrupt. Working roads would do more to reduce nutritional deficits than any G.M.O. possibly could, and so would a more equitable distribution of the Earth's dwindling supply of freshwater. No single crop or approach to farming can possibly feed the world. To prevent billions of people from living in hunger, we will need to use every one of them.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 An activist's controversial crusade against genetically modified crops. Early this spring, the Indian envi-ronmentalist Vandana Shiva led an unusual pilgrimage across southern Europe. Beginning in Greece, with the international Pan-Hellenic Exchange of Local Seed Varieties Festival, which celebrated the virtues of traditional agriculture, Shiva and an entourage of followers crossed the Adriatic and travelled by bus up the boot of Italy, to Florence, where she spoke at the Seed, Food and Earth Democracy Festival. After a short planning meeting in Genoa, the caravan rolled on to the South of France, ending in Le Mas d'Azil, just in time to celebrate International Days of the Seed. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 Shiva's fiery opposition to globalization and to the use of genetically modified crops has made her a hero to anti-G.M.O. activists everywhere. The purpose of the trip through Europe, she had told me a few weeks earlier, was to focus attention there on "the voices of those who want their agriculture to be free of poison and G.M.O.s." At each stop, Shiva delivered a message that she has honed for nearly three decades: by engineering, patenting, and transforming seeds into costly packets of intellectual property, multinational corporations such as Monsanto, with considerable assistance from the World Bank, the World Trade Organization, the United States government, and even philanthropies like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, are attempting to impose "food totalitarianism" on the world. She describes the fight against agricultural biotechnology as a global war against a few giant seed companies on behalf of the billions of farmers who depend on what they themselves grow to survive. Shiva contends that nothing less than the future of humanity rides on the outcome. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 "There are two trends," she told the crowd that had gathered in Piazza Santissima Annunziata, in Florence, for the seed fair. "One: a trend of diversity, democracy, freedom, joy, culture--people celebrating their lives." She paused to let silence fill the square. "And the other: monocultures, deadness. Everyone depressed. Everyone on Prozac. More and more young people unemployed. We don't want that world of death." The audience, a mixture of people attending the festival and tourists on their way to the Duomo, stood transfixed. Shiva, dressed in a burgundy sari and a shawl the color of rust, was a formidable sight. "We would have no hunger in the world if the seed was in the hands of the farmers and gardeners and the land was in the hands of the farmers," she said. "They want to take that away." 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 Shiva, along with a growing army of supporters, argues that the prevailing model of industrial agriculture, heavily reliant on chemical fertilizers, pesticides, fossil fuels, and a seemingly limitless supply of cheap water, places an unacceptable burden on the Earth's resources. She promotes, as most knowledgeable farmers do, more diversity in crops, greater care for the soil, and more support for people who work the land every day. Shiva has particular contempt for farmers who plant monocultures--vast fields of a single crop. "They are ruining the planet," she told me. "They are destroying this beautiful world." 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 The global food supply is indeed in danger. Feeding the expanding population without further harming the Earth presents one of the greatest challenges of our time, perhaps of all time. By the end of the century, the world may well have to accommodate ten billion inhabitants--roughly the equivalent of adding two new Indias. Sustaining that many people will require farmers to grow more food in the next seventy-five years than has been produced in all of human history. For most of the past ten thousand years, feeding more people simply meant farming more land. That option no longer exists; nearly every arable patch of ground has been cultivated, and irrigation for agriculture already consumes seventy per cent of the Earth's freshwater. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 The nutritional demands of the developing world's rapidly growing middle class--more protein from pork, beef, chicken, and eggs--will add to the pressure; so will the ecological impact of climate change, particularly in India and other countries where farmers depend on monsoons. Many scientists are convinced that we can hope to meet those demands only with help from the advanced tools of plant genetics. Shiva disagrees; she looks upon any seed bred in a laboratory as an abomination. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 The fight has not been easy. Few technologies, not the car, the phone, or even the computer, have been adopted as rapidly and as widely as the products of agricultural biotechnology. Between 1996, when genetically engineered crops were first planted, and last year, the area they cover has increased a hundredfold--from seventeen million hectares to a hundred and seventy million. Nearly half of the world's soybeans and a third of its corn are products of biotechnology. Cotton that has been engineered to repel the devastating bollworm dominates the Indian market, as it does almost everywhere it has been introduced. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 Those statistics have not deterred Shiva. At the age of sixty- one, she is constantly in motion: this year, she has travelled not only across Europe but throughout South Asia, Africa, and Canada, and twice to the United States. In the past quarter century, she has turned out nearly a book a year, including "The Violence of the Green Revolution," "Monocultures of the Mind," "Stolen Harvest," and "Water Wars." In each, she has argued that modern agricultural practices have done little but plunder the Earth.Vandana Shiva accuses multinational corporations such as Monsanto of attempting to impose "food totalitarianism" on the world.

She has been called the Gandhi of grain and compared to Mother Teresa. If she personally accepted all the awards, degrees, and honors offered to her, she would have time for little else. In 1993, Shiva received the Right Livelihood Award, often called the alternative Nobel Prize, for her activism on behalf of ecology and women. Time, the Guardian, Forbes, and Asia Week have all placed her on lists of the world's most important activists. Shiva, who holds a Ph.D. in philosophy from the University of Western Ontario, has received honorary doctorates from universities in Paris, Oslo, and Toronto, among others. In 2010, she was awarded the Sydney Peace Prize for her commitment to social justice and her tireless efforts on behalf of the poor. Earlier this year, Beloit College, in Wisconsin, honored Shiva with its Weissberg Chair in International Studies, calling her "a one-woman movement for peace, sustainability, and social justice."

"Our commitment is to make sure that dictatorship never flourishes." While she spoke, I stood among the volunteers who were selling heirloom vegetable seeds and handing out information about organic farming. Most were Italian college students in for the day from Bologna or Rome, and few could take their eyes off her. I asked a twenty-year-old student named Victoria if she had been aware of Shiva's work. "For years," she said. Then, acknowledging Shiva's undeniable charisma, she added, "I was just in a room with her. I have followed her all my life, but you can't be prepared for her physical presence." She hesitated and glanced at the platform where Shiva was speaking. "Isn't she just magic?"

In 1943 alone, during the final years of the British Raj, more than two million people died in the Bengal Famine. "By the time we became free of colonial rule, the country was sucked dry," Suman Sahai told me recently. Sahai, a geneticist and a prominent environmental activist, is the founder of the Delhi-based Gene Campaign, a farmers'-rights organization. "The British destroyed the agricultural system and made no investments. They wanted food to feed their Army and food to sell overseas. They cared about nothing else." Independence, in 1947, brought euphoria but also desperation. Tons of grain were imported each year from the United States; without it, famine would have been inevitable. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 To become independent in more than name, India also needed to become self-reliant. The Green Revolution--a series of agricultural innovations producing improved varieties of wheat that could respond better to irrigation and benefit from fertilizer--provided that opportunity. In 1966, India imported eleven million tons of grain. Today, it produces more than two hundred million tons, much of it for export. Between 1950 and the end of the twentieth century, the world's grain production rose from seven hundred million tons to 1.9 billion, all on nearly the same amount of land.

"It would have been a different planet, smaller, poorer, and far more agrarian." Adamchack runs an organic farm in Northern California, and has served as the president of California Certified Organic Farmers. His wife, Pamela Ronald, is a professor of plant genetics at the University of California at Davis, and their book "Tomorrow's Table" was among the first to demonstrate the ways in which advanced technologies can combine with traditional farming to help feed the world.

Shiva believes that it destroyed India's traditional way of life. "Until the 1960s, India was successfully pursuing an agricultural development policy based on strengthening the ecological base of agriculture and the self-reliance of peasants," she writes in "The Violence of the Green Revolution." She told me that, by shifting the focus of farming from variety to productivity, the Green Revolution actually was responsible for killing Indian farmers. Few people accept that analysis, though, and more than one study has concluded that if India had stuck to its traditional farming methods millions would have starved. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 The Green Revolution relied heavily on fertilizers and pesticides, but in the nineteen-sixties little thought was given to the environmental consequences. Runoff polluted many rivers and lakes, and some of India's best farmland was destroyed. "At first, the Green Revolution was wonderful," Sahai told me. "But, without a lot of water, it could not be sustained, and it should have ended long before it did."

S. Swaminathan has called "an evergreen revolution," one that combines the most advanced science with a clear focus on sustaining the environment. Until recently, these have seemed like separate goals. For thousands of years, people have crossed sexually compatible plants and then chosen among their offspring for what seemed like desirable characteristics (sturdy roots, for example, or resistance to disease). Farmers learned how to make better plants and varieties, but it was a process of trial and error until the middle of the nineteenth century, when Gregor Mendel demonstrated that many of the characteristics of a pea plant were passed from one generation to the next according to predictable rules. That created a new science, genetics, which helped make breeding far more precise. Nearly all the plants we cultivate--corn, wheat, rice, roses, Christmas trees--have been genetically modified through breeding to last longer, look better, taste sweeter, or grow more vigorously in arid soil.

By inserting genes from one species into another, plant breeders today can select traits with even greater specificity. Bt cotton, for instance, contains genes from a bacterium, Bacillus thuringiensis, that is found naturally in the soil. The bacterium produces a toxin that targets cotton bollworm, a pest that infests millions of acres each year. Twenty-five per cent of the world's insecticides have typically been used on cotton, and many of them are carcinogenic. By engineering part of the bacterium's DNA into a cotton seed, scientists made it possible for the cotton boll to produce its own insecticide. Soon after the pest bites the plant, it dies.

But it has also prompted a rancorous debate over the consequences of that knowledge. Genetically modified products have often been advertised as the best way to slow the impact of climate change, produce greater yields, provide more nutrients in food, and feed the world's poorest people. Most of the transgenic crops on the market today, however, have been designed to meet the needs of industrial farmers and their customers in the West.

And they worry that pollen from genetically engineered crops will drift into the wild, altering plant ecosystems forever. Many people, however, raise an even more fundamental objection: crossing varieties and growing them in fields is one thing, but using a gene gun to fire a bacterium into seeds seems like a violation of the rules of life.

A Brahmin, she was raised in prosperity. Her father was a forestry official for the Indian government; her mother worked as a school inspector in Lahore, and, after Partition, when the city became part of Pakistan, she returned to India. In the nineteen- seventies, Shiva joined a women's movement that was determined to prevent outside logging companies from cutting down forests in the highlands of northern India. Their tactic was simple and, ultimately, successful: they would form a circle and hug the trees. Shiva was, literally, one of the early tree huggers. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 The first time we spoke, in New York, she explained why she became an environmental activist. "I was busy with quantum theory for my doctoral work, so I had no idea what was going on with the Green Revolution," she said. Shiva had studied physics as an undergraduate. We were sitting in a small cafe near the United Nations, where she was about to attend an agricultural forum. She had just stepped off the plane from New Delhi, but she gathered energy as she told her story. "In the late eighties, I went to a conference on biotechnology, on the future of food," she said. "There were no genetically modified organisms then. These people were talking about having to do genetic engineering in order to take patents. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 "They said the most amazing things," she went on. "They said Europe and the U.S. are too small a market. We have to have a global market, and that is why we need an intellectual-property-rights law." That meeting set her on a new trajectory. "I realized they want to patent life, and life is not an invention," she said. "They want to release G.M.O.s without testing, and they want to impose this order worldwide. I decided on the flight back I didn't want that world." She returned to India and started Navdanya, which in Hindi means "nine seeds." According to its mandate, the organization was created to "protect the diversity and integrity of living resources, especially native seed, and to promote organic farming and fair trade." Under Shiva's leadership, Navdanya rapidly evolved into a national movement. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 In contrast to most agricultural ecologists, Shiva remains committed to the idea that organic farming can feed the world. Owing almost wholly to the efforts of Shiva and other activists, India has not approved a single genetically modified food crop for human consumption. Only four African nations--South Africa, Burkina Faso, Egypt, and Sudan--permit the commercial use of products that contain G.M.O.s. Europe remains the epicenter of anti-G.M.O. advocacy, but recent polls show that the vast majority of Americans, ever more focussed on the connection between food, farming, and their health, favor mandatory labelling for products that are made with genetically modified ingredients. Most say they would use such labels to avoid eating those foods. For her part, Shiva insists that the only acceptable path is to return to the principles and practices of an earlier era. "Fertilizer should never have been allowed in agriculture," she said in a 2011 speech. "I think it's time to ban it. It's a weapon of mass destruction. Its use is like war, because it came from war." 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 Like Gandhi, whom she reveres, Shiva questions many of the goals of contemporary civilization. Last year, Prince Charles, who keeps a bust of Shiva on display at Highgrove, his family house, visited her at the Navdanya farm, in Dehradun, about a hundred and fifty miles north of New Delhi. Charles, perhaps the world's best-known critic of modern life, has for years denounced transgenic crops. "This kind of genetic modification takes mankind into realms that belong to God and God alone," he wrote in the nineteen-nineties, when Monsanto tried to sell its genetically engineered seeds in Europe. Shiva, too, invokes religion in her assault on agricultural biotechnology. "G.M.O. stands for 'God, Move Over,' we are the creators now," she said in a speech earlier this year. Navdanya does not report its contributions publicly, but, according to a recent Indian government report, foreign N.G.O.s have contributed significantly in the past decade to help the campaign against adoption of G.M.O.s in India. In June, the government banned most such contributions. Shiva, who was named in the report, called it "an attack on civil society," and biased in favor of foreign corporations. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 Shiva maintains a savvy presence in social media, and her tweets, intense and dramatic, circulate rapidly among tens of thousands of followers across the globe. They also allow her to police the movement and ostracize defectors. The British environmentalist Mark Lynas, for example, stood strongly against the use of biotechnology in agriculture for more than a decade. But last year, after careful study of the scientific data on which his assumptions were based, he reversed his position. In a speech to the annual Oxford Farming Conference, he described as "green urban myths" his former view that genetically modified crops increase reliance on chemicals, pose dangers to the environment, and threaten human health. "For the record, here and up front, I apologize for having spent several years ripping up G.M. crops," he said. "I am also sorry that I . . . assisted in demonizing an important technological option which can be used to benefit the environment." Lynas now regards the assumption that the world could be fed solely with organic food as "simplistic nonsense."

"If you want to get your name splattered all over the Web, there's nothing like recanting your once strongly held beliefs," Jason Mark, the editor of Earth Island Journal, wrote. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 Perhaps nobody was more incensed by Lynas's conversion than Shiva, who expressed her anger on Twitter: "#MarkLynas saying farmers shd be free to grow #GMOs which can contaminate #organic farms is like saying #rapists shd have freedom to rape." The message caused immediate outrage. "Shame on you for comparing GMOs to rape," Karl Haro von Mogel, who runs Biology Fortified, a Web site devoted to plant genetics, responded, also in a tweet. "That is a despicable argument that devalues women, men, and children." Shiva tweeted back at once. "We need to move from a patriarchal, anthropocentric worldview to one based on #EarthDemocracy," she wrote. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 Shiva has a flair for incendiary analogies. Recently, she compared what she calls "seed slavery," inflicted upon the world by the forces of globalization, to human slavery. "When starting to fight for seed freedom, it's because I saw a parallel," she said at a food conference in the Netherlands. "That time, it was blacks who were captured in Africa and taken to work on the cotton and sugarcane fields of America. Today, it is all of life being enslaved. All of life. All species." 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 Shiva cannot tolerate any group that endorses the use of genetic engineering in agriculture, no matter what else the organization does, or how qualified its support. When I mentioned that Monsanto, in addition to making genetically engineered seeds, has also become one of the world's largest producers of conventionally bred seeds, she laughed. "That's just public relations," she said. She has a similarly low regard for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which has taken strong positions in support of biotechnology. Not long ago, Shiva wrote that the billions of dollars the foundation has invested in agricultural research and assistance poses "the greatest threat to farmers in the developing world." She dismisses the American scientific organizations responsible for regulating genetically modified products, including the Food and Drug Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the United States Department of Agriculture, as little more than tools of the international seed conglomerates. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 At times, Shiva's absolutism about G.M.O.s can lead her in strange directions. In 1999, ten thousand people were killed and millions were left homeless when a cyclone hit India's eastern coastal state of Orissa. When the U.S. government dispatched grain and soy to help feed the desperate victims, Shiva held a news conference in New Delhi and said that the donation was proof that "the United States has been using the Orissa victims as guinea pigs" for genetically engineered products. She also wrote to the international relief agency Oxfam to say that she hoped it wasn't planning to send genetically modified foods to feed the starving survivors. When neither the U.S. nor Oxfam altered its plans, she condemned the Indian government for accepting the provisions. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 On March 29th, in Winnipeg, Shiva began a speech to a local food- rights group by revealing alarming new information about the impact of agricultural biotechnology on human health. "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said that in two years the figure of autism has jumped from one in eighty-eight to one in sixty- eight," she said, referring to an article in USA Today. "Then they go on to say obviously this is a trend showing that something's wrong, and that whether something in the environment could be causing the uptick remains the million-dollar question. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 "That question's been answered," Shiva continued. She mentioned glyphosate, the Monsanto herbicide that is commonly used with modified crops. "If you look at the graph of the growth of G.M.O.s, the growth of application of glyphosate and autism, it's literally a one-to-one correspondence. And you could make that graph for kidney failure, you could make that graph for diabetes, you could make that graph even for Alzheimer's." 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 Hundreds of millions of people, in twenty-eight countries, eat transgenic products every day, and if any of Shiva's assertions were true the implications would be catastrophic. But no relationship between glyphosate and the diseases that Shiva mentioned has been discovered. Her claims were based on a single research paper, released last year, in a journal called Entropy, which charges scientists to publish their findings. The paper contains no new research. Shiva had committed a common, but dangerous, fallacy: confusing a correlation with causation. (It turns out, for example, that the growth in sales of organic produce in the past decade matches the rise of autism, almost exactly. For that matter, so does the rise in sales of high-definition televisions, as well as the number of Americans who commute to work every day by bicycle.) 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 Shiva refers to her scientific credentials in almost every appearance, yet she often dispenses with the conventions of scientific inquiry. She is usually described in interviews and on television as a nuclear physicist, a quantum physicist, or a world- renowned physicist. Most of her book jackets include the following biographical note: "Before becoming an activist, Vandana Shiva was one of India's leading physicists." When I asked if she had ever worked as a physicist, she suggested that I search for the answer on Google. I found nothing, and she doesn't list any such position in her biography. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 Shiva argues that because many varieties of corn, soybeans, and canola have been engineered to resist glyphosate, there has been an increase in the use of herbicides. That is certainly true, and in high enough amounts glyphosate, like other herbicides, is toxic. Moreover, whenever farmers rely too heavily on one chemical, whether it occurs naturally or is made in a factory, weeds develop resistance. In some regions, that has already happened with glyphosate--and the results can be disastrous. But farmers face the problem whether or not they plant genetically modified crops. Scores of weed species have become resistant to the herbicide atrazine, for example, even though no crops have been modified to tolerate it. In fact, glyphosate has become the most popular herbicide in the world, largely because it's not nearly so toxic as those which it generally replaces. The E.P.A. has labelled water unsafe to drink if it contains three parts per billion of atrazine; the comparable limit for glyphosate is seven hundred parts per billion. By this measure, glyphosate is two hundred and thirty times less toxic than atrazine.

But since 1996, when the crops were first planted, humans have consumed trillions of servings of foods that contain genetically engineered ingredients, and have draped themselves in thousands of tons of clothing made from genetically engineered cotton, yet there has not been a single documented case of any person becoming ill as a result. That is one reason that the National Academy of Sciences, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the World Health Organization, the U.K.'s Royal Society, the French Academy of Sciences, the European Commission, and dozens of other scientific organizations have all concluded that foods derived from genetically modified crops are as safe to eat as any other food.

Conway is the former president of the Rockefeller Foundation and a professor at London's Imperial College. His book "One Billion Hungry: Can We Feed the World?" has become an essential text for those who study poverty, agriculture, and development.

"Truth be damned. People in the rich world love to dabble in a past they were lucky enough to avoid--you know, a couple of chickens running around with the children in the back yard. But farming is bloody tough, as anyone who does it knows. It is like those people who romanticize villages in the developing world. Nobody who ever lived in one would do that."

I drove east from Auran-gabad on rutted roadways, where the contradictions of modern India are always on display: bright-green pyramids of sweet limes, along with wooden trinkets, jewelry salesmen, cell-phone stands, and elaborately decorated water delivery trucks. Behind the stands were giant, newly constructed houses, all safely tucked away in gated communities. Regional power companies in that part of the country pay two rupees (about three cents) a kilogram for discarded cotton stalks, and, as I drove past, the fields were full of women pulling them out of the ground. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 Although India bans genetically modified food crops, Bt cotton, modified to resist the bollworm, is planted widely. Since the nineteen-nineties, Shiva has focussed the world's attention on Maharashtra by referring to the region as India's "suicide belt," and saying that Monsanto's introduction of genetically modified cotton there has caused a "genocide." There is no place where the battle over the value, safety, ecological impact, and economic implications of genetically engineered products has been fought more fiercely. Shiva says that two hundred and eighty-four thousand Indian farmers have killed themselves because they cannot afford to plant Bt cotton. Earlier this year, she said, "Farmers are dying because Monsanto is making profits--by owning life that it never created but it pretends to create. That is why we need to reclaim the seed. That is why we need to get rid of the G.M.O.s. That is why we need to stop the patenting of life."

She seemed to know that, but said that the only way I could understand the scale of the disaster would be to visit the region myself. She also proposed that I join the seed caravan in Europe and then travel with her to the Navdanya farm. We exchanged several logistical texts and e-mails, but by the time I got to Italy Shiva had stopped writing or responding to my messages. In Florence, where she spoke to me briefly as she walked to a meeting, she said that I could try to see her in New Delhi but she doubted that she would be free. When I arrived in India, one of her assistants told me that I should submit any questions in writing. I did, but Shiva declined to answer them.

But Bt cotton has been planted by millions of people in the developing world, many of whom maintain lots not much larger than the back yard of a house in the American suburbs. In India, more than seven million farmers, occupying twenty-six million acres, have adopted the technology. That's nearly ninety per cent of all Indian cotton fields. At first, the new seeds were extremely expensive. Counterfeiters flooded the market with fakes and sold them, as well as fake glyphosate, at reduced prices. The crops failed, and many people suffered. Shiva said last year that Bt-cotton-seed costs had risen by eight thousand per cent in India since 2002. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 In fact, the prices of modified seeds, which are regulated by the government, have fallen steadily. While they remain higher than those of conventional seeds, in most cases the modified seeds provide greater benefits. According to the International Food Policy Research Institute, Bt farmers spend at least fifteen per cent more on crops, but their pesticide costs are fifty per cent lower. Since the seed was introduced, yields have increased by more than a hundred and fifty per cent. Only China grows and sells more cotton.

That is not the case in India. The Farmers' Rights Act of 2001 guarantees every person the right to "save, use, sow, resow, exchange, share, or sell" his seeds. Most farmers, though, even those with tiny fields, choose to buy newly bred seeds each year, whether genetically engineered or not, because they insure better yields and bigger profits.

Dhoksal is about three hundred miles northeast of Mumbai, but it seems to belong to another century. It's dusty and tired, and by noon the temperature had passed a hundred degrees. The majority of local farmers travel to the market by bullock cart. Some walk, and a few drive. A week earlier, a local agricultural inspector told me, he had seen a cotton farmer on an elephant and waved to him. The man did not respond, however, because he was too busy talking on his cell phone.

The first thing that the cotton farmers I visited wanted to discuss, though, was their improved health and that of their families. Before Bt genes were inserted into cotton, they would typically spray their crops with powerful chemicals dozens of times each season. Now they spray once a month. Bt is not toxic to humans or to other mammals. Organic farmers, who have strict rules against using synthetic fertilizers or chemicals, have used a spray version of the toxin on their crops for years.

"Before Bt cotton came in, we used the other seeds," Rameshwar Mamdev told me when I stopped by his six-acre farm, not far from the main dirt road that leads to the village. He plants corn in addition to cotton. "My wife would spray," he said. "She would get sick. We would all get sick." According to a recent study by the Flemish Institute for Biotechnology, there has been a sevenfold reduction in the use of pesticide since the introduction of Bt cotton; the number of cases of pesticide poisoning has fallen by nearly ninety per cent. Similar reductions have occurred in China. The growers, particularly women, by reducing their exposure to insecticide, not only have lowered their risk of serious illness but also are able to spend more time with their children.

One concern is that their pollen will drift into the surrounding environment. Pollen does spread, but that doesn't happen so easily; producing new seeds requires a sexually compatible plant. Farmers can reduce the risk of contamination by staggering planting schedules, which insures that different kinds of plants pollinate at different times. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 There is a bigger problem: pests can develop resistance to the toxins in engineered crops. The bollworm isn't Bt cotton's only enemy; the plant has many other pests as well. In the U.S., Bt- cotton farmers are required to use a "refuge" strategy: they surround their Bt crops with a moat of plants that do not make Bt toxins. This forces pests that develop resistance to Bt cotton to mate with pests that have not. In most cases, they will produce offspring that are still susceptible. Natural selection breeds resistance; such tactics only delay the process. But this is true everywhere in nature, not just on farms. Treatments for infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and H.I.V. rely on a cocktail of drugs because the infection would quickly grow resistant to a single medication. Nevertheless, none of the farmers I spoke with in Dhoksal planted a refuge. When I asked why, they had no idea what I was talking about.

In 2011, an American filmmaker, Micha Peled, released "Bitter Seeds," which argues that Monsanto and its seeds have been responsible for the suicides of thousands of farmers. The film received warm recommendations from food activists in the U.S. "Films like this can change the world," the celebrity chef Alice Waters said when she saw it. As the journalist Keith Kloor pointed out earlier this year, in the journal Issues in Science and Technology, the farmer-suicide story even found its way into the scientific community. Last October, at a public discussion devoted to food security, the Stanford biologist Paul Ehrlich stated that Monsanto had "killed most of those farmers in India." Ehrlich also famously predicted, in the nineteen-sixties, that famine would strike India and that, within a decade, "hundreds of millions of people will starve to death." Not only was he wrong but, between 1965 and 1972, India's wheat production doubled.

Although many Indian farmers kill themselves, their suicide rate has not risen in a decade, according to a study by Ian Plewis, of the University of Manchester. In fact, the suicide rate among Indian farmers is lower than for other Indians and is comparable to that among French farmers. Plewis found that "the pattern of changes in suicide rates over the last fifteen years is consistent with a beneficial effect of Bt cotton for India as a whole, albeit perhaps not in every cotton-growing state."

The only commercial farmers in the United States without crop insurance are those who have a philosophical objection to government support. In India, if you fail you are on your own. Farmers all need credit, but banks will rarely lend to them. "We want to send our children to school," Pawar told me. "We want to live better. We want to buy equipment. But when the crop fails we cannot pay." In most cases, there is no choice but to turn to money lenders, and, in villages like Dhoksal, they are often the same people who sell seeds. The annual interest rate on loans can rise to forty per cent, which few farmers anywhere could hope to pay.

Sahai is not ideologically opposed to the use of genetically engineered crops, but she believes that the Indian government regulates them poorly. Nonetheless, she says that the Bt- suicide talk is exaggerated. "If you revoked the permit to plant Bt cotton tomorrow, would that stop suicides on farms?" she said. "It wouldn't make much difference. Studies have shown that unbearable credit and a lack of financial support for agriculture is the killer. It's hardly a secret." 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 It would be presumptuous to generalize about the complex financial realities of India's two hundred and sixty million farmers after having met a dozen of them. But I neither saw nor heard anything that supported Vandana Shiva's theory that Bt cotton has caused an "epidemic" of suicides. "When you call somebody a fraud, that suggests the person knows she is lying," Mark Lynas told me on the phone recently. "I don't think Vandana Shiva necessarily knows that. But she is blinded by her ideology and her political beliefs. That is why she is so effective and so dangerous." Lynas currently advises the Bangladeshi government on trials it is conducting of Bt brinjal (eggplant), a crop that, despite several peer-reviewed approvals, was rejected by the environmental minister in India. Brinjal is the first G.M. food crop in South Asia. Shiva wrote recently that the Bangladeshi project not only will fail but will kill the farmers who participate.

Shiva has repeatedly said that the company should be tried for "ecocide and genocide." When I asked Monsanto's chairman, Hugh Grant, how he dealt with such charges, he looked at me and shook his head, slowly. "We are a science-based company," he said. "I feel very strongly that you need to be grounded in the science or you lose the drift." 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 It was an unusually hot day in St. Louis, where Monsanto has its headquarters, and Grant was in shirtsleeves, rolled halfway up his arm. "Obviously, I am an optimistic Scotsman," he said, in an accent that has been softened by many years in the U.S. "Or I would be doing something else for a living." Grant often stresses the need to develop crops that use less water--and has argued for years that G.M.O.s alone could never feed the world. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 Nonetheless, Monsanto has pursued the market for transgenic crops with a zeal that has sometimes troubled even proponents of the underlying science. "When G.M. technology was in its infancy, many people were concerned," Anne Glover, the chief scientific adviser to the president of the European Commission, said recently. Glover considers it unethical to ignore G.M. crops if other approaches have failed. "People are still concerned about G.M.," she said. "Most of them are uneasy not with the technology per se but, rather, with the business practices in the agrifood sector, which is dominated by multinational companies." She said that those companies need to do a much better job of communicating with their customers. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 Grant concedes the point. "For years, we would have said that we are a biotech company," he said. "We are so far down the food chain . . . we always felt that we were divorced from what ends up on the shelf. And we are not." He noted that, during the past fifty years, the connection between American farmers and their customers had become increasingly tenuous, but that had begun to change. "People may despise us," he said, "but we are all talking about the same issues now, and that is a change I welcome. Food and agriculture are finally part of the conversation." Grant told me that, in 2002, he had commissioned a study to explore the idea of changing the company's name. "It would have cost twenty-five million dollars," he said. "At the time, that seemed like a waste of money." He paused for a moment. "It was my call, and it was a big mistake." 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 The all-encompassing obsession with Monsanto has made rational discussion of the risks and benefits of genetically modified products difficult. Many academic scientists who don't work for Monsanto or any other large corporation are struggling to develop crops that have added nutrients and others that will tolerate drought, floods, or salty soil--all traits needed desperately by the world's poorest farmers. Golden Rice--enriched with vitamin A--is the best-known example. More than a hundred and ninety million children under the age of five suffer from vitamin-A deficiency. Every year, as many as half a million will go blind. Rice plants produce beta carotene, the precursor to vitamin A, in the leaves but not in the grain. To make Golden Rice, scientists insert genes in the edible part of the plant, too. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 Golden Rice would never offer more than a partial solution to micronutrient deficiency, and the intellectual-property rights have long been controlled by the nonprofit International Rice Research Institute, which makes the rights available to researchers at no cost. Still, after more than a decade of opposition, the rice is prohibited everywhere. Two economists, one from Berkeley and the other from Munich, recently examined the impact of that ban. In their study "The Economic Power of the Golden Rice Opposition," they calculated that the absence of Golden Rice in the past decade has caused the loss of at least 1,424,680 life years in India alone. (Earlier this year, vandals destroyed some of the world's first test plots, in the Philippines.)

"In Africa, the pests and diseases of agriculture are as devastating as human diseases," Gordon Conway, who is on the board of the African Agricultural Technology Foundation, told me. He added that the impact of diseases like the fungus black sigatoka, the parasitic weed striga, and the newly identified syndrome maize lethal necrosis- -all of which attack Africa's most important crops--are "in many instances every bit as deadly as H.I.V. and TB." For years, in Tanzania, a disease called brown-streak virus has attacked cassava, a critical source of carbohydrates in the region. Researchers have developed a virus-resistant version of the starchy root vegetable, which is now being tested in field trials. But, again, the opposition, led in part by Shiva, who visited this summer, has been strong. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 Maize is the most commonly grown staple crop in Africa, but it is highly susceptible to drought. Researchers are working on a strain that resists both striga and the African endemic maize-streak virus; there have also been promising advances with insect-resistant cowpea and nutritionally enriched sorghum. Other scientists are working on plants that greatly reduce the need for nitrogen fertilizers, and several that produce healthful omega-3 fatty acids. None of the products have so far managed to overcome regulatory opposition. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 While I was in India, I visited Deepak Pental, the former vice- chancellor of the University of Delhi. Pental, an elegant, soft- spoken man, is a professor of genetics and also one of the country's most distinguished scientists. "We made a mistake in hyper- propagandizing G.M. products, saying it was a technology that would sort out every problem," he began. "The hype has hurt us." Pental, who received his doctorate from Rutgers, has devoted much of his career to research on Brassica juncea, mustard seed. Mustard and canola, Brassica napus, share a common parent. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 Mustard is grown on six million hectares in India. There are parts of the country where farmers raise few other crops. "We have developed a line of mustard oil with a composition that is even better than olive oil," he said. "It has a lot of omega-3 in it, and that is essential for a vegetarian food"--not a minor consideration in a country with half a billion people who eat no meat. The pungency that most people associate with mustard has been bred out of the oil, which is also low in saturated fats. "It is a beautiful, robust system," he said, adding that there have been several successful trials of the mustard seed. "All our work was funded by the public. Nobody will see any profits; that was never our intention. It is a safe, nutritious, and important crop." It also grows well in dry soil. Yet it was made in a laboratory, and, two decades later, the seed remains on the shelf. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 Nearly twenty per cent of the world's population lives in India. But the country has only five per cent of the planet's potable water. "Every time we export one kilogram of basmati rice, we export five thousand kilograms of water," Pental said. "This is a suicidal path. We have no nutritional priorities. We are exporting millions of tons of soy meal to Asia. The Japanese feed it to cows. The nutritive value of what a cow is eating in Japan is more than what a human being eats in India. This has to stop." 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 Pental struggled to keep the disappointment out of his voice. "White rice is the most ridiculous food that human beings can cultivate," he said. "It is just a bunch of starch, and we are filling our bellies with it." He shrugged. "But it's natural," he said, placing ironic emphasis on the final word. "So it passes the Luddite test." 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 In a recent speech, Shiva explained why she rejects studies suggesting that genetically engineered products like Pental's mustard oil are safe. Monsanto, she said, had simply paid for false stories, and "now they control the entire scientific literature of the world." Nature, Science, and Scientific American, three widely admired publications, "have just become extensions of their propaganda. There is no independent science left in the world." 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 Monsanto is certainly rich, but it is simply not that powerful. Exxon Mobil is worth seven times as much as Monsanto, yet it has never been able to alter the scientific consensus that burning fossil fuels is the principal cause of climate change. Tobacco companies spend more money lobbying in Washington each year than Monsanto does, but it's hard to find scientists who endorse smoking. The gulf between the truth about G.M.O.s and what people say about them keeps growing wider. The Internet brims with videos that purport to expose the lies about genetically modified products. Mike Adams, who runs a popular Web site called Natural News, recently compared journalists who are critical of anti-G.M.O. activists such as Shiva to Nazi collaborators. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 The most persistent objection to agricultural biotechnology, and the most common, is that, by cutting DNA from one species and splicing it into another, we have crossed an invisible line and created forms of life unlike anything found in "nature." That fear is unquestionably sincere. Yet, as a walk through any supermarket would demonstrate, nearly every food we eat has been modi-fied, if not by genetic engineering then by more traditional cross-breeding, or by nature itself. Corn in its present form wouldn't exist if humans hadn't cultivated the crop. The plant doesn't grow in the wild and would not survive if we suddenly stopped eating it. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 When it comes to medicine, most Americans couldn't care less about nature's boundaries. Surgeons routinely suture pig valves into the hearts of humans; the operation has kept tens of thousands of people alive. Synthetic insulin, the first genetically modified product, is consumed each day by millions of diabetics. To make the drug, scientists insert human proteins into a common bacteria, which is then grown in giant industrial vats. Protesters don't march to oppose those advances. In fact, consumers demand them, and it doesn't seem to matter where the replacement parts come from. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 When Shiva writes that "Golden Rice will make the malnutrition crisis worse" and that it will kill people, she reinforces the worst fears of her largely Western audience. Much of what she says resonates with the many people who feel that profit-seeking corporations hold too much power over the food they eat. Theirs is an argument well worth making. But her statements are rarely supported by data, and her positions often seem more like those of an end-of-days mystic than like those of a scientist.

It would be far better if the world's foods contained an adequate supply of vitamins. It would also help the people of many poverty- stricken countries if their governments were less corrupt. Working roads would do more to reduce nutritional deficits than any G.M.O. possibly could, and so would a more equitable distribution of the Earth's dwindling supply of freshwater. No single crop or approach to farming can possibly feed the world. To prevent billions of people from living in hunger, we will need to use every one of them.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 An activist's controversial crusade against genetically modified crops. Early this spring, the Indian envi-ronmentalist Vandana Shiva led an unusual pilgrimage across southern Europe. Beginning in Greece, with the international Pan-Hellenic Exchange of Local Seed Varieties Festival, which celebrated the virtues of traditional agriculture, Shiva and an entourage of followers crossed the Adriatic and travelled by bus up the boot of Italy, to Florence, where she spoke at the Seed, Food and Earth Democracy Festival. After a short planning meeting in Genoa, the caravan rolled on to the South of France, ending in Le Mas d'Azil, just in time to celebrate International Days of the Seed. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 Shiva's fiery opposition to globalization and to the use of genetically modified crops has made her a hero to anti-G.M.O. activists everywhere. The purpose of the trip through Europe, she had told me a few weeks earlier, was to focus attention there on "the voices of those who want their agriculture to be free of poison and G.M.O.s." At each stop, Shiva delivered a message that she has honed for nearly three decades: by engineering, patenting, and transforming seeds into costly packets of intellectual property, multinational corporations such as Monsanto, with considerable assistance from the World Bank, the World Trade Organization, the United States government, and even philanthropies like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, are attempting to impose "food totalitarianism" on the world. She describes the fight against agricultural biotechnology as a global war against a few giant seed companies on behalf of the billions of farmers who depend on what they themselves grow to survive. Shiva contends that nothing less than the future of humanity rides on the outcome. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 "There are two trends," she told the crowd that had gathered in Piazza Santissima Annunziata, in Florence, for the seed fair. "One: a trend of diversity, democracy, freedom, joy, culture--people celebrating their lives." She paused to let silence fill the square. "And the other: monocultures, deadness. Everyone depressed. Everyone on Prozac. More and more young people unemployed. We don't want that world of death." The audience, a mixture of people attending the festival and tourists on their way to the Duomo, stood transfixed. Shiva, dressed in a burgundy sari and a shawl the color of rust, was a formidable sight. "We would have no hunger in the world if the seed was in the hands of the farmers and gardeners and the land was in the hands of the farmers," she said. "They want to take that away." 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 Shiva, along with a growing army of supporters, argues that the prevailing model of industrial agriculture, heavily reliant on chemical fertilizers, pesticides, fossil fuels, and a seemingly limitless supply of cheap water, places an unacceptable burden on the Earth's resources. She promotes, as most knowledgeable farmers do, more diversity in crops, greater care for the soil, and more support for people who work the land every day. Shiva has particular contempt for farmers who plant monocultures--vast fields of a single crop. "They are ruining the planet," she told me. "They are destroying this beautiful world." 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 The global food supply is indeed in danger. Feeding the expanding population without further harming the Earth presents one of the greatest challenges of our time, perhaps of all time. By the end of the century, the world may well have to accommodate ten billion inhabitants--roughly the equivalent of adding two new Indias. Sustaining that many people will require farmers to grow more food in the next seventy-five years than has been produced in all of human history. For most of the past ten thousand years, feeding more people simply meant farming more land. That option no longer exists; nearly every arable patch of ground has been cultivated, and irrigation for agriculture already consumes seventy per cent of the Earth's freshwater. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 The nutritional demands of the developing world's rapidly growing middle class--more protein from pork, beef, chicken, and eggs--will add to the pressure; so will the ecological impact of climate change, particularly in India and other countries where farmers depend on monsoons. Many scientists are convinced that we can hope to meet those demands only with help from the advanced tools of plant genetics. Shiva disagrees; she looks upon any seed bred in a laboratory as an abomination. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 The fight has not been easy. Few technologies, not the car, the phone, or even the computer, have been adopted as rapidly and as widely as the products of agricultural biotechnology. Between 1996, when genetically engineered crops were first planted, and last year, the area they cover has increased a hundredfold--from seventeen million hectares to a hundred and seventy million. Nearly half of the world's soybeans and a third of its corn are products of biotechnology. Cotton that has been engineered to repel the devastating bollworm dominates the Indian market, as it does almost everywhere it has been introduced. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 Those statistics have not deterred Shiva. At the age of sixty- one, she is constantly in motion: this year, she has travelled not only across Europe but throughout South Asia, Africa, and Canada, and twice to the United States. In the past quarter century, she has turned out nearly a book a year, including "The Violence of the Green Revolution," "Monocultures of the Mind," "Stolen Harvest," and "Water Wars." In each, she has argued that modern agricultural practices have done little but plunder the Earth.Vandana Shiva accuses multinational corporations such as Monsanto of attempting to impose "food totalitarianism" on the world. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 Nowhere is Shiva embraced more fully than in the West, where, as Bill Moyers recently noted, she has become a "rock star in the worldwide battle against genetically modified seeds." She has been called the Gandhi of grain and compared to Mother Teresa. If she personally accepted all the awards, degrees, and honors offered to her, she would have time for little else. In 1993, Shiva received the Right Livelihood Award, often called the alternative Nobel Prize, for her activism on behalf of ecology and women. Time, the Guardian, Forbes, and Asia Week have all placed her on lists of the world's most important activists. Shiva, who holds a Ph.D. in philosophy from the University of Western Ontario, has received honorary doctorates from universities in Paris, Oslo, and Toronto, among others. In 2010, she was awarded the Sydney Peace Prize for her commitment to social justice and her tireless efforts on behalf of the poor. Earlier this year, Beloit College, in Wisconsin, honored Shiva with its Weissberg Chair in International Studies, calling her "a one-woman movement for peace, sustainability, and social justice." 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 "For me, the idea of owning intellectual-property rights for seeds is a bad, pathetic attempt at seed dictatorship," Shiva told the audience in Florence. "Our commitment is to make sure that dictatorship never flourishes." While she spoke, I stood among the volunteers who were selling heirloom vegetable seeds and handing out information about organic farming. Most were Italian college students in for the day from Bologna or Rome, and few could take their eyes off her. I asked a twenty-year-old student named Victoria if she had been aware of Shiva's work. "For years," she said. Then, acknowledging Shiva's undeniable charisma, she added, "I was just in a room with her. I have followed her all my life, but you can't be prepared for her physical presence." She hesitated and glanced at the platform where Shiva was speaking. "Isn't she just magic?"

In 1943 alone, during the final years of the British Raj, more than two million people died in the Bengal Famine. "By the time we became free of colonial rule, the country was sucked dry," Suman Sahai told me recently. Sahai, a geneticist and a prominent environmental activist, is the founder of the Delhi-based Gene Campaign, a farmers'-rights organization. "The British destroyed the agricultural system and made no investments. They wanted food to feed their Army and food to sell overseas. They cared about nothing else." Independence, in 1947, brought euphoria but also desperation. Tons of grain were imported each year from the United States; without it, famine would have been inevitable. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 To become independent in more than name, India also needed to become self-reliant. The Green Revolution--a series of agricultural innovations producing improved varieties of wheat that could respond better to irrigation and benefit from fertilizer--provided that opportunity. In 1966, India imported eleven million tons of grain. Today, it produces more than two hundred million tons, much of it for export. Between 1950 and the end of the twentieth century, the world's grain production rose from seven hundred million tons to 1.9 billion, all on nearly the same amount of land.

"It would have been a different planet, smaller, poorer, and far more agrarian." Adamchack runs an organic farm in Northern California, and has served as the president of California Certified Organic Farmers. His wife, Pamela Ronald, is a professor of plant genetics at the University of California at Davis, and their book "Tomorrow's Table" was among the first to demonstrate the ways in which advanced technologies can combine with traditional farming to help feed the world. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 There is another perspective on the Green Revolution. Shiva believes that it destroyed India's traditional way of life. "Until the 1960s, India was successfully pursuing an agricultural development policy based on strengthening the ecological base of agriculture and the self-reliance of peasants," she writes in "The Violence of the Green Revolution." She told me that, by shifting the focus of farming from variety to productivity, the Green Revolution actually was responsible for killing Indian farmers. Few people accept that analysis, though, and more than one study has concluded that if India had stuck to its traditional farming methods millions would have starved. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 The Green Revolution relied heavily on fertilizers and pesticides, but in the nineteen-sixties little thought was given to the environmental consequences. Runoff polluted many rivers and lakes, and some of India's best farmland was destroyed. "At first, the Green Revolution was wonderful," Sahai told me. "But, without a lot of water, it could not be sustained, and it should have ended long before it did."

S. Swaminathan has called "an evergreen revolution," one that combines the most advanced science with a clear focus on sustaining the environment. Until recently, these have seemed like separate goals. For thousands of years, people have crossed sexually compatible plants and then chosen among their offspring for what seemed like desirable characteristics (sturdy roots, for example, or resistance to disease). Farmers learned how to make better plants and varieties, but it was a process of trial and error until the middle of the nineteenth century, when Gregor Mendel demonstrated that many of the characteristics of a pea plant were passed from one generation to the next according to predictable rules. That created a new science, genetics, which helped make breeding far more precise. Nearly all the plants we cultivate--corn, wheat, rice, roses, Christmas trees--have been genetically modified through breeding to last longer, look better, taste sweeter, or grow more vigorously in arid soil.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28Genetic engineering takes the process one step further. By inserting genes from one species into another, plant breeders today can select traits with even greater specificity. Bt cotton, for instance, contains genes from a bacterium, Bacillus thuringiensis, that is found naturally in the soil. The bacterium produces a toxin that targets cotton bollworm, a pest that infests millions of acres each year. Twenty-five per cent of the world's insecticides have typically been used on cotton, and many of them are carcinogenic. By engineering part of the bacterium's DNA into a cotton seed, scientists made it possible for the cotton boll to produce its own insecticide. Soon after the pest bites the plant, it dies.

But it has also prompted a rancorous debate over the consequences of that knowledge. Genetically modified products have often been advertised as the best way to slow the impact of climate change, produce greater yields, provide more nutrients in food, and feed the world's poorest people. Most of the transgenic crops on the market today, however, have been designed to meet the needs of industrial farmers and their customers in the West.

And they worry that pollen from genetically engineered crops will drift into the wild, altering plant ecosystems forever. Many people, however, raise an even more fundamental objection: crossing varieties and growing them in fields is one thing, but using a gene gun to fire a bacterium into seeds seems like a violation of the rules of life.

A Brahmin, she was raised in prosperity. Her father was a forestry official for the Indian government; her mother worked as a school inspector in Lahore, and, after Partition, when the city became part of Pakistan, she returned to India. In the nineteen- seventies, Shiva joined a women's movement that was determined to prevent outside logging companies from cutting down forests in the highlands of northern India. Their tactic was simple and, ultimately, successful: they would form a circle and hug the trees. Shiva was, literally, one of the early tree huggers.

"I was busy with quantum theory for my doctoral work, so I had no idea what was going on with the Green Revolution," she said. Shiva had studied physics as an undergraduate. We were sitting in a small cafe near the United Nations, where she was about to attend an agricultural forum. She had just stepped off the plane from New Delhi, but she gathered energy as she told her story. "In the late eighties, I went to a conference on biotechnology, on the future of food," she said. "There were no genetically modified organisms then. These people were talking about having to do genetic engineering in order to take patents. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 "They said the most amazing things," she went on. "They said Europe and the U.S. are too small a market. We have to have a global market, and that is why we need an intellectual-property-rights law." That meeting set her on a new trajectory. "I realized they want to patent life, and life is not an invention," she said. "They want to release G.M.O.s without testing, and they want to impose this order worldwide. I decided on the flight back I didn't want that world." She returned to India and started Navdanya, which in Hindi means "nine seeds." According to its mandate, the organization was created to "protect the diversity and integrity of living resources, especially native seed, and to promote organic farming and fair trade." Under Shiva's leadership, Navdanya rapidly evolved into a national movement. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 In contrast to most agricultural ecologists, Shiva remains committed to the idea that organic farming can feed the world. Owing almost wholly to the efforts of Shiva and other activists, India has not approved a single genetically modified food crop for human consumption. Only four African nations--South Africa, Burkina Faso, Egypt, and Sudan--permit the commercial use of products that contain G.M.O.s. Europe remains the epicenter of anti-G.M.O. advocacy, but recent polls show that the vast majority of Americans, ever more focussed on the connection between food, farming, and their health, favor mandatory labelling for products that are made with genetically modified ingredients. Most say they would use such labels to avoid eating those foods. For her part, Shiva insists that the only acceptable path is to return to the principles and practices of an earlier era. "Fertilizer should never have been allowed in agriculture," she said in a 2011 speech. "I think it's time to ban it. It's a weapon of mass destruction. Its use is like war, because it came from war." 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 Like Gandhi, whom she reveres, Shiva questions many of the goals of contemporary civilization. Last year, Prince Charles, who keeps a bust of Shiva on display at Highgrove, his family house, visited her at the Navdanya farm, in Dehradun, about a hundred and fifty miles north of New Delhi. Charles, perhaps the world's best-known critic of modern life, has for years denounced transgenic crops. "This kind of genetic modification takes mankind into realms that belong to God and God alone," he wrote in the nineteen-nineties, when Monsanto tried to sell its genetically engineered seeds in Europe. Shiva, too, invokes religion in her assault on agricultural biotechnology. "G.M.O. stands for 'God, Move Over,' we are the creators now," she said in a speech earlier this year. Navdanya does not report its contributions publicly, but, according to a recent Indian government report, foreign N.G.O.s have contributed significantly in the past decade to help the campaign against adoption of G.M.O.s in India. In June, the government banned most such contributions. Shiva, who was named in the report, called it "an attack on civil society," and biased in favor of foreign corporations.

They also allow her to police the movement and ostracize defectors. The British environmentalist Mark Lynas, for example, stood strongly against the use of biotechnology in agriculture for more than a decade. But last year, after careful study of the scientific data on which his assumptions were based, he reversed his position. In a speech to the annual Oxford Farming Conference, he described as "green urban myths" his former view that genetically modified crops increase reliance on chemicals, pose dangers to the environment, and threaten human health. "For the record, here and up front, I apologize for having spent several years ripping up G.M. crops," he said. "I am also sorry that I . . . assisted in demonizing an important technological option which can be used to benefit the environment." Lynas now regards the assumption that the world could be fed solely with organic food as "simplistic nonsense." 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 With that speech, and the publicity that accompanied it, Lynas became the Benedict Arnold of the anti-G.M.O. movement. "If you want to get your name splattered all over the Web, there's nothing like recanting your once strongly held beliefs," Jason Mark, the editor of Earth Island Journal, wrote. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 Perhaps nobody was more incensed by Lynas's conversion than Shiva, who expressed her anger on Twitter: "#MarkLynas saying farmers shd be free to grow #GMOs which can contaminate #organic farms is like saying #rapists shd have freedom to rape." The message caused immediate outrage. "Shame on you for comparing GMOs to rape," Karl Haro von Mogel, who runs Biology Fortified, a Web site devoted to plant genetics, responded, also in a tweet. "That is a despicable argument that devalues women, men, and children." Shiva tweeted back at once. "We need to move from a patriarchal, anthropocentric worldview to one based on #EarthDemocracy," she wrote. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 Shiva has a flair for incendiary analogies. Recently, she compared what she calls "seed slavery," inflicted upon the world by the forces of globalization, to human slavery. "When starting to fight for seed freedom, it's because I saw a parallel," she said at a food conference in the Netherlands. "That time, it was blacks who were captured in Africa and taken to work on the cotton and sugarcane fields of America. Today, it is all of life being enslaved. All of life. All species." 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 Shiva cannot tolerate any group that endorses the use of genetic engineering in agriculture, no matter what else the organization does, or how qualified its support. When I mentioned that Monsanto, in addition to making genetically engineered seeds, has also become one of the world's largest producers of conventionally bred seeds, she laughed. "That's just public relations," she said. She has a similarly low regard for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which has taken strong positions in support of biotechnology. Not long ago, Shiva wrote that the billions of dollars the foundation has invested in agricultural research and assistance poses "the greatest threat to farmers in the developing world." She dismisses the American scientific organizations responsible for regulating genetically modified products, including the Food and Drug Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the United States Department of Agriculture, as little more than tools of the international seed conglomerates. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 At times, Shiva's absolutism about G.M.O.s can lead her in strange directions. In 1999, ten thousand people were killed and millions were left homeless when a cyclone hit India's eastern coastal state of Orissa. When the U.S. government dispatched grain and soy to help feed the desperate victims, Shiva held a news conference in New Delhi and said that the donation was proof that "the United States has been using the Orissa victims as guinea pigs" for genetically engineered products. She also wrote to the international relief agency Oxfam to say that she hoped it wasn't planning to send genetically modified foods to feed the starving survivors. When neither the U.S. nor Oxfam altered its plans, she condemned the Indian government for accepting the provisions. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 On March 29th, in Winnipeg, Shiva began a speech to a local food- rights group by revealing alarming new information about the impact of agricultural biotechnology on human health. "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said that in two years the figure of autism has jumped from one in eighty-eight to one in sixty- eight," she said, referring to an article in USA Today. "Then they go on to say obviously this is a trend showing that something's wrong, and that whether something in the environment could be causing the uptick remains the million-dollar question. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 "That question's been answered," Shiva continued. She mentioned glyphosate, the Monsanto herbicide that is commonly used with modified crops. "If you look at the graph of the growth of G.M.O.s, the growth of application of glyphosate and autism, it's literally a one-to-one correspondence. And you could make that graph for kidney failure, you could make that graph for diabetes, you could make that graph even for Alzheimer's." 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 Hundreds of millions of people, in twenty-eight countries, eat transgenic products every day, and if any of Shiva's assertions were true the implications would be catastrophic. But no relationship between glyphosate and the diseases that Shiva mentioned has been discovered. Her claims were based on a single research paper, released last year, in a journal called Entropy, which charges scientists to publish their findings. The paper contains no new research. Shiva had committed a common, but dangerous, fallacy: confusing a correlation with causation. (It turns out, for example, that the growth in sales of organic produce in the past decade matches the rise of autism, almost exactly. For that matter, so does the rise in sales of high-definition televisions, as well as the number of Americans who commute to work every day by bicycle.) 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 Shiva refers to her scientific credentials in almost every appearance, yet she often dispenses with the conventions of scientific inquiry. She is usually described in interviews and on television as a nuclear physicist, a quantum physicist, or a world- renowned physicist. Most of her book jackets include the following biographical note: "Before becoming an activist, Vandana Shiva was one of India's leading physicists." When I asked if she had ever worked as a physicist, she suggested that I search for the answer on Google. I found nothing, and she doesn't list any such position in her biography. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 Shiva argues that because many varieties of corn, soybeans, and canola have been engineered to resist glyphosate, there has been an increase in the use of herbicides. That is certainly true, and in high enough amounts glyphosate, like other herbicides, is toxic. Moreover, whenever farmers rely too heavily on one chemical, whether it occurs naturally or is made in a factory, weeds develop resistance. In some regions, that has already happened with glyphosate--and the results can be disastrous. But farmers face the problem whether or not they plant genetically modified crops. Scores of weed species have become resistant to the herbicide atrazine, for example, even though no crops have been modified to tolerate it. In fact, glyphosate has become the most popular herbicide in the world, largely because it's not nearly so toxic as those which it generally replaces. The E.P.A. has labelled water unsafe to drink if it contains three parts per billion of atrazine; the comparable limit for glyphosate is seven hundred parts per billion. By this measure, glyphosate is two hundred and thirty times less toxic than atrazine.

But since 1996, when the crops were first planted, humans have consumed trillions of servings of foods that contain genetically engineered ingredients, and have draped themselves in thousands of tons of clothing made from genetically engineered cotton, yet there has not been a single documented case of any person becoming ill as a result. That is one reason that the National Academy of Sciences, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the World Health Organization, the U.K.'s Royal Society, the French Academy of Sciences, the European Commission, and dozens of other scientific organizations have all concluded that foods derived from genetically modified crops are as safe to eat as any other food.

Conway is the former president of the Rockefeller Foundation and a professor at London's Imperial College. His book "One Billion Hungry: Can We Feed the World?" has become an essential text for those who study poverty, agriculture, and development.

"Truth be damned. People in the rich world love to dabble in a past they were lucky enough to avoid--you know, a couple of chickens running around with the children in the back yard. But farming is bloody tough, as anyone who does it knows. It is like those people who romanticize villages in the developing world. Nobody who ever lived in one would do that."

I drove east from Auran-gabad on rutted roadways, where the contradictions of modern India are always on display: bright-green pyramids of sweet limes, along with wooden trinkets, jewelry salesmen, cell-phone stands, and elaborately decorated water delivery trucks. Behind the stands were giant, newly constructed houses, all safely tucked away in gated communities. Regional power companies in that part of the country pay two rupees (about three cents) a kilogram for discarded cotton stalks, and, as I drove past, the fields were full of women pulling them out of the ground. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 Although India bans genetically modified food crops, Bt cotton, modified to resist the bollworm, is planted widely. Since the nineteen-nineties, Shiva has focussed the world's attention on Maharashtra by referring to the region as India's "suicide belt," and saying that Monsanto's introduction of genetically modified cotton there has caused a "genocide." There is no place where the battle over the value, safety, ecological impact, and economic implications of genetically engineered products has been fought more fiercely. Shiva says that two hundred and eighty-four thousand Indian farmers have killed themselves because they cannot afford to plant Bt cotton. Earlier this year, she said, "Farmers are dying because Monsanto is making profits--by owning life that it never created but it pretends to create. That is why we need to reclaim the seed. That is why we need to get rid of the G.M.O.s. That is why we need to stop the patenting of life."

She seemed to know that, but said that the only way I could understand the scale of the disaster would be to visit the region myself. She also proposed that I join the seed caravan in Europe and then travel with her to the Navdanya farm. We exchanged several logistical texts and e-mails, but by the time I got to Italy Shiva had stopped writing or responding to my messages. In Florence, where she spoke to me briefly as she walked to a meeting, she said that I could try to see her in New Delhi but she doubted that she would be free. When I arrived in India, one of her assistants told me that I should submit any questions in writing. I did, but Shiva declined to answer them.

But Bt cotton has been planted by millions of people in the developing world, many of whom maintain lots not much larger than the back yard of a house in the American suburbs. In India, more than seven million farmers, occupying twenty-six million acres, have adopted the technology. That's nearly ninety per cent of all Indian cotton fields. At first, the new seeds were extremely expensive. Counterfeiters flooded the market with fakes and sold them, as well as fake glyphosate, at reduced prices. The crops failed, and many people suffered. Shiva said last year that Bt-cotton-seed costs had risen by eight thousand per cent in India since 2002. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 In fact, the prices of modified seeds, which are regulated by the government, have fallen steadily. While they remain higher than those of conventional seeds, in most cases the modified seeds provide greater benefits. According to the International Food Policy Research Institute, Bt farmers spend at least fifteen per cent more on crops, but their pesticide costs are fifty per cent lower. Since the seed was introduced, yields have increased by more than a hundred and fifty per cent. Only China grows and sells more cotton.

That is not the case in India. The Farmers' Rights Act of 2001 guarantees every person the right to "save, use, sow, resow, exchange, share, or sell" his seeds. Most farmers, though, even those with tiny fields, choose to buy newly bred seeds each year, whether genetically engineered or not, because they insure better yields and bigger profits.

Dhoksal is about three hundred miles northeast of Mumbai, but it seems to belong to another century. It's dusty and tired, and by noon the temperature had passed a hundred degrees. The majority of local farmers travel to the market by bullock cart. Some walk, and a few drive. A week earlier, a local agricultural inspector told me, he had seen a cotton farmer on an elephant and waved to him. The man did not respond, however, because he was too busy talking on his cell phone.

The first thing that the cotton farmers I visited wanted to discuss, though, was their improved health and that of their families. Before Bt genes were inserted into cotton, they would typically spray their crops with powerful chemicals dozens of times each season. Now they spray once a month. Bt is not toxic to humans or to other mammals. Organic farmers, who have strict rules against using synthetic fertilizers or chemicals, have used a spray version of the toxin on their crops for years.

"Before Bt cotton came in, we used the other seeds," Rameshwar Mamdev told me when I stopped by his six-acre farm, not far from the main dirt road that leads to the village. He plants corn in addition to cotton. "My wife would spray," he said. "She would get sick. We would all get sick." According to a recent study by the Flemish Institute for Biotechnology, there has been a sevenfold reduction in the use of pesticide since the introduction of Bt cotton; the number of cases of pesticide poisoning has fallen by nearly ninety per cent. Similar reductions have occurred in China. The growers, particularly women, by reducing their exposure to insecticide, not only have lowered their risk of serious illness but also are able to spend more time with their children.

One concern is that their pollen will drift into the surrounding environment. Pollen does spread, but that doesn't happen so easily; producing new seeds requires a sexually compatible plant. Farmers can reduce the risk of contamination by staggering planting schedules, which insures that different kinds of plants pollinate at different times. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 There is a bigger problem: pests can develop resistance to the toxins in engineered crops. The bollworm isn't Bt cotton's only enemy; the plant has many other pests as well. In the U.S., Bt- cotton farmers are required to use a "refuge" strategy: they surround their Bt crops with a moat of plants that do not make Bt toxins. This forces pests that develop resistance to Bt cotton to mate with pests that have not. In most cases, they will produce offspring that are still susceptible. Natural selection breeds resistance; such tactics only delay the process. But this is true everywhere in nature, not just on farms. Treatments for infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and H.I.V. rely on a cocktail of drugs because the infection would quickly grow resistant to a single medication. Nevertheless, none of the farmers I spoke with in Dhoksal planted a refuge. When I asked why, they had no idea what I was talking about.

In 2011, an American filmmaker, Micha Peled, released "Bitter Seeds," which argues that Monsanto and its seeds have been responsible for the suicides of thousands of farmers. The film received warm recommendations from food activists in the U.S. "Films like this can change the world," the celebrity chef Alice Waters said when she saw it. As the journalist Keith Kloor pointed out earlier this year, in the journal Issues in Science and Technology, the farmer-suicide story even found its way into the scientific community. Last October, at a public discussion devoted to food security, the Stanford biologist Paul Ehrlich stated that Monsanto had "killed most of those farmers in India." Ehrlich also famously predicted, in the nineteen-sixties, that famine would strike India and that, within a decade, "hundreds of millions of people will starve to death." Not only was he wrong but, between 1965 and 1972, India's wheat production doubled.

Although many Indian farmers kill themselves, their suicide rate has not risen in a decade, according to a study by Ian Plewis, of the University of Manchester. In fact, the suicide rate among Indian farmers is lower than for other Indians and is comparable to that among French farmers. Plewis found that "the pattern of changes in suicide rates over the last fifteen years is consistent with a beneficial effect of Bt cotton for India as a whole, albeit perhaps not in every cotton-growing state."

The only commercial farmers in the United States without crop insurance are those who have a philosophical objection to government support. In India, if you fail you are on your own. Farmers all need credit, but banks will rarely lend to them. "We want to send our children to school," Pawar told me. "We want to live better. We want to buy equipment. But when the crop fails we cannot pay." In most cases, there is no choice but to turn to money lenders, and, in villages like Dhoksal, they are often the same people who sell seeds. The annual interest rate on loans can rise to forty per cent, which few farmers anywhere could hope to pay.

Sahai is not ideologically opposed to the use of genetically engineered crops, but she believes that the Indian government regulates them poorly. Nonetheless, she says that the Bt- suicide talk is exaggerated. "If you revoked the permit to plant Bt cotton tomorrow, would that stop suicides on farms?" she said. "It wouldn't make much difference. Studies have shown that unbearable credit and a lack of financial support for agriculture is the killer. It's hardly a secret."

But I neither saw nor heard anything that supported Vandana Shiva's theory that Bt cotton has caused an "epidemic" of suicides. "When you call somebody a fraud, that suggests the person knows she is lying," Mark Lynas told me on the phone recently. "I don't think Vandana Shiva necessarily knows that. But she is blinded by her ideology and her political beliefs. That is why she is so effective and so dangerous." Lynas currently advises the Bangladeshi government on trials it is conducting of Bt brinjal (eggplant), a crop that, despite several peer-reviewed approvals, was rejected by the environmental minister in India. Brinjal is the first G.M. food crop in South Asia. Shiva wrote recently that the Bangladeshi project not only will fail but will kill the farmers who participate.

Shiva has repeatedly said that the company should be tried for "ecocide and genocide." When I asked Monsanto's chairman, Hugh Grant, how he dealt with such charges, he looked at me and shook his head, slowly. "We are a science-based company," he said. "I feel very strongly that you need to be grounded in the science or you lose the drift." 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 It was an unusually hot day in St. Louis, where Monsanto has its headquarters, and Grant was in shirtsleeves, rolled halfway up his arm. "Obviously, I am an optimistic Scotsman," he said, in an accent that has been softened by many years in the U.S. "Or I would be doing something else for a living." Grant often stresses the need to develop crops that use less water--and has argued for years that G.M.O.s alone could never feed the world. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 Nonetheless, Monsanto has pursued the market for transgenic crops with a zeal that has sometimes troubled even proponents of the underlying science. "When G.M. technology was in its infancy, many people were concerned," Anne Glover, the chief scientific adviser to the president of the European Commission, said recently. Glover considers it unethical to ignore G.M. crops if other approaches have failed. "People are still concerned about G.M.," she said. "Most of them are uneasy not with the technology per se but, rather, with the business practices in the agrifood sector, which is dominated by multinational companies." She said that those companies need to do a much better job of communicating with their customers. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 Grant concedes the point. "For years, we would have said that we are a biotech company," he said. "We are so far down the food chain . . . we always felt that we were divorced from what ends up on the shelf. And we are not." He noted that, during the past fifty years, the connection between American farmers and their customers had become increasingly tenuous, but that had begun to change. "People may despise us," he said, "but we are all talking about the same issues now, and that is a change I welcome. Food and agriculture are finally part of the conversation." Grant told me that, in 2002, he had commissioned a study to explore the idea of changing the company's name. "It would have cost twenty-five million dollars," he said. "At the time, that seemed like a waste of money." He paused for a moment. "It was my call, and it was a big mistake."

Many academic scientists who don't work for Monsanto or any other large corporation are struggling to develop crops that have added nutrients and others that will tolerate drought, floods, or salty soil--all traits needed desperately by the world's poorest farmers. Golden Rice--enriched with vitamin A--is the best-known example. More than a hundred and ninety million children under the age of five suffer from vitamin-A deficiency. Every year, as many as half a million will go blind. Rice plants produce beta carotene, the precursor to vitamin A, in the leaves but not in the grain. To make Golden Rice, scientists insert genes in the edible part of the plant, too. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 Golden Rice would never offer more than a partial solution to micronutrient deficiency, and the intellectual-property rights have long been controlled by the nonprofit International Rice Research Institute, which makes the rights available to researchers at no cost. Still, after more than a decade of opposition, the rice is prohibited everywhere. Two economists, one from Berkeley and the other from Munich, recently examined the impact of that ban. In their study "The Economic Power of the Golden Rice Opposition," they calculated that the absence of Golden Rice in the past decade has caused the loss of at least 1,424,680 life years in India alone. (Earlier this year, vandals destroyed some of the world's first test plots, in the Philippines.)

"In Africa, the pests and diseases of agriculture are as devastating as human diseases," Gordon Conway, who is on the board of the African Agricultural Technology Foundation, told me. He added that the impact of diseases like the fungus black sigatoka, the parasitic weed striga, and the newly identified syndrome maize lethal necrosis- -all of which attack Africa's most important crops--are "in many instances every bit as deadly as H.I.V. and TB." For years, in Tanzania, a disease called brown-streak virus has attacked cassava, a critical source of carbohydrates in the region. Researchers have developed a virus-resistant version of the starchy root vegetable, which is now being tested in field trials. But, again, the opposition, led in part by Shiva, who visited this summer, has been strong. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 Maize is the most commonly grown staple crop in Africa, but it is highly susceptible to drought. Researchers are working on a strain that resists both striga and the African endemic maize-streak virus; there have also been promising advances with insect-resistant cowpea and nutritionally enriched sorghum. Other scientists are working on plants that greatly reduce the need for nitrogen fertilizers, and several that produce healthful omega-3 fatty acids. None of the products have so far managed to overcome regulatory opposition.

Pental, an elegant, soft- spoken man, is a professor of genetics and also one of the country's most distinguished scientists. "We made a mistake in hyper- propagandizing G.M. products, saying it was a technology that would sort out every problem," he began. "The hype has hurt us." Pental, who received his doctorate from Rutgers, has devoted much of his career to research on Brassica juncea, mustard seed. Mustard and canola, Brassica napus, share a common parent. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 Mustard is grown on six million hectares in India. There are parts of the country where farmers raise few other crops. "We have developed a line of mustard oil with a composition that is even better than olive oil," he said. "It has a lot of omega-3 in it, and that is essential for a vegetarian food"--not a minor consideration in a country with half a billion people who eat no meat. The pungency that most people associate with mustard has been bred out of the oil, which is also low in saturated fats. "It is a beautiful, robust system," he said, adding that there have been several successful trials of the mustard seed. "All our work was funded by the public. Nobody will see any profits; that was never our intention. It is a safe, nutritious, and important crop." It also grows well in dry soil. Yet it was made in a laboratory, and, two decades later, the seed remains on the shelf. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 Nearly twenty per cent of the world's population lives in India. But the country has only five per cent of the planet's potable water. "Every time we export one kilogram of basmati rice, we export five thousand kilograms of water," Pental said. "This is a suicidal path. We have no nutritional priorities. We are exporting millions of tons of soy meal to Asia. The Japanese feed it to cows. The nutritive value of what a cow is eating in Japan is more than what a human being eats in India. This has to stop." 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 Pental struggled to keep the disappointment out of his voice. "White rice is the most ridiculous food that human beings can cultivate," he said. "It is just a bunch of starch, and we are filling our bellies with it." He shrugged. "But it's natural," he said, placing ironic emphasis on the final word. "So it passes the Luddite test." 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 In a recent speech, Shiva explained why she rejects studies suggesting that genetically engineered products like Pental's mustard oil are safe. Monsanto, she said, had simply paid for false stories, and "now they control the entire scientific literature of the world." Nature, Science, and Scientific American, three widely admired publications, "have just become extensions of their propaganda. There is no independent science left in the world." 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 Monsanto is certainly rich, but it is simply not that powerful. Exxon Mobil is worth seven times as much as Monsanto, yet it has never been able to alter the scientific consensus that burning fossil fuels is the principal cause of climate change. Tobacco companies spend more money lobbying in Washington each year than Monsanto does, but it's hard to find scientists who endorse smoking. The gulf between the truth about G.M.O.s and what people say about them keeps growing wider. The Internet brims with videos that purport to expose the lies about genetically modified products. Mike Adams, who runs a popular Web site called Natural News, recently compared journalists who are critical of anti-G.M.O. activists such as Shiva to Nazi collaborators. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 The most persistent objection to agricultural biotechnology, and the most common, is that, by cutting DNA from one species and splicing it into another, we have crossed an invisible line and created forms of life unlike anything found in "nature." That fear is unquestionably sincere. Yet, as a walk through any supermarket would demonstrate, nearly every food we eat has been modi-fied, if not by genetic engineering then by more traditional cross-breeding, or by nature itself. Corn in its present form wouldn't exist if humans hadn't cultivated the crop. The plant doesn't grow in the wild and would not survive if we suddenly stopped eating it.

Surgeons routinely suture pig valves into the hearts of humans; the operation has kept tens of thousands of people alive. Synthetic insulin, the first genetically modified product, is consumed each day by millions of diabetics. To make the drug, scientists insert human proteins into a common bacteria, which is then grown in giant industrial vats. Protesters don't march to oppose those advances. In fact, consumers demand them, and it doesn't seem to matter where the replacement parts come from. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 When Shiva writes that "Golden Rice will make the malnutrition crisis worse" and that it will kill people, she reinforces the worst fears of her largely Western audience. Much of what she says resonates with the many people who feel that profit-seeking corporations hold too much power over the food they eat. Theirs is an argument well worth making. But her statements are rarely supported by data, and her positions often seem more like those of an end-of-days mystic than like those of a scientist.

It would be far better if the world's foods contained an adequate supply of vitamins. It would also help the people of many poverty- stricken countries if their governments were less corrupt. Working roads would do more to reduce nutritional deficits than any G.M.O. possibly could, and so would a more equitable distribution of the Earth's dwindling supply of freshwater. No single crop or approach to farming can possibly feed the world. To prevent billions of people from living in hunger, we will need to use every one of them.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 An activist's controversial crusade against genetically modified crops. Early this spring, the Indian envi-ronmentalist Vandana Shiva led an unusual pilgrimage across southern Europe. Beginning in Greece, with the international Pan-Hellenic Exchange of Local Seed Varieties Festival, which celebrated the virtues of traditional agriculture, Shiva and an entourage of followers crossed the Adriatic and travelled by bus up the boot of Italy, to Florence, where she spoke at the Seed, Food and Earth Democracy Festival. After a short planning meeting in Genoa, the caravan rolled on to the South of France, ending in Le Mas d'Azil, just in time to celebrate International Days of the Seed. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 Shiva's fiery opposition to globalization and to the use of genetically modified crops has made her a hero to anti-G.M.O. activists everywhere. The purpose of the trip through Europe, she had told me a few weeks earlier, was to focus attention there on "the voices of those who want their agriculture to be free of poison and G.M.O.s." At each stop, Shiva delivered a message that she has honed for nearly three decades: by engineering, patenting, and transforming seeds into costly packets of intellectual property, multinational corporations such as Monsanto, with considerable assistance from the World Bank, the World Trade Organization, the United States government, and even philanthropies like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, are attempting to impose "food totalitarianism" on the world. She describes the fight against agricultural biotechnology as a global war against a few giant seed companies on behalf of the billions of farmers who depend on what they themselves grow to survive. Shiva contends that nothing less than the future of humanity rides on the outcome. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 "There are two trends," she told the crowd that had gathered in Piazza Santissima Annunziata, in Florence, for the seed fair. "One: a trend of diversity, democracy, freedom, joy, culture--people celebrating their lives." She paused to let silence fill the square. "And the other: monocultures, deadness. Everyone depressed. Everyone on Prozac. More and more young people unemployed. We don't want that world of death." The audience, a mixture of people attending the festival and tourists on their way to the Duomo, stood transfixed. Shiva, dressed in a burgundy sari and a shawl the color of rust, was a formidable sight. "We would have no hunger in the world if the seed was in the hands of the farmers and gardeners and the land was in the hands of the farmers," she said. "They want to take that away." 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 Shiva, along with a growing army of supporters, argues that the prevailing model of industrial agriculture, heavily reliant on chemical fertilizers, pesticides, fossil fuels, and a seemingly limitless supply of cheap water, places an unacceptable burden on the Earth's resources. She promotes, as most knowledgeable farmers do, more diversity in crops, greater care for the soil, and more support for people who work the land every day. Shiva has particular contempt for farmers who plant monocultures--vast fields of a single crop. "They are ruining the planet," she told me. "They are destroying this beautiful world." 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 The global food supply is indeed in danger. Feeding the expanding population without further harming the Earth presents one of the greatest challenges of our time, perhaps of all time. By the end of the century, the world may well have to accommodate ten billion inhabitants--roughly the equivalent of adding two new Indias. Sustaining that many people will require farmers to grow more food in the next seventy-five years than has been produced in all of human history. For most of the past ten thousand years, feeding more people simply meant farming more land. That option no longer exists; nearly every arable patch of ground has been cultivated, and irrigation for agriculture already consumes seventy per cent of the Earth's freshwater. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 The nutritional demands of the developing world's rapidly growing middle class--more protein from pork, beef, chicken, and eggs--will add to the pressure; so will the ecological impact of climate change, particularly in India and other countries where farmers depend on monsoons. Many scientists are convinced that we can hope to meet those demands only with help from the advanced tools of plant genetics. Shiva disagrees; she looks upon any seed bred in a laboratory as an abomination. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 The fight has not been easy. Few technologies, not the car, the phone, or even the computer, have been adopted as rapidly and as widely as the products of agricultural biotechnology. Between 1996, when genetically engineered crops were first planted, and last year, the area they cover has increased a hundredfold--from seventeen million hectares to a hundred and seventy million. Nearly half of the world's soybeans and a third of its corn are products of biotechnology. Cotton that has been engineered to repel the devastating bollworm dominates the Indian market, as it does almost everywhere it has been introduced. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 Those statistics have not deterred Shiva. At the age of sixty- one, she is constantly in motion: this year, she has travelled not only across Europe but throughout South Asia, Africa, and Canada, and twice to the United States. In the past quarter century, she has turned out nearly a book a year, including "The Violence of the Green Revolution," "Monocultures of the Mind," "Stolen Harvest," and "Water Wars." In each, she has argued that modern agricultural practices have done little but plunder the Earth.Vandana Shiva accuses multinational corporations such as Monsanto of attempting to impose "food totalitarianism" on the world.

She has been called the Gandhi of grain and compared to Mother Teresa. If she personally accepted all the awards, degrees, and honors offered to her, she would have time for little else. In 1993, Shiva received the Right Livelihood Award, often called the alternative Nobel Prize, for her activism on behalf of ecology and women. Time, the Guardian, Forbes, and Asia Week have all placed her on lists of the world's most important activists. Shiva, who holds a Ph.D. in philosophy from the University of Western Ontario, has received honorary doctorates from universities in Paris, Oslo, and Toronto, among others. In 2010, she was awarded the Sydney Peace Prize for her commitment to social justice and her tireless efforts on behalf of the poor. Earlier this year, Beloit College, in Wisconsin, honored Shiva with its Weissberg Chair in International Studies, calling her "a one-woman movement for peace, sustainability, and social justice."

"Our commitment is to make sure that dictatorship never flourishes." While she spoke, I stood among the volunteers who were selling heirloom vegetable seeds and handing out information about organic farming. Most were Italian college students in for the day from Bologna or Rome, and few could take their eyes off her. I asked a twenty-year-old student named Victoria if she had been aware of Shiva's work. "For years," she said. Then, acknowledging Shiva's undeniable charisma, she added, "I was just in a room with her. I have followed her all my life, but you can't be prepared for her physical presence." She hesitated and glanced at the platform where Shiva was speaking. "Isn't she just magic?"

In 1943 alone, during the final years of the British Raj, more than two million people died in the Bengal Famine. "By the time we became free of colonial rule, the country was sucked dry," Suman Sahai told me recently. Sahai, a geneticist and a prominent environmental activist, is the founder of the Delhi-based Gene Campaign, a farmers'-rights organization. "The British destroyed the agricultural system and made no investments. They wanted food to feed their Army and food to sell overseas. They cared about nothing else." Independence, in 1947, brought euphoria but also desperation. Tons of grain were imported each year from the United States; without it, famine would have been inevitable. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 To become independent in more than name, India also needed to become self-reliant. The Green Revolution--a series of agricultural innovations producing improved varieties of wheat that could respond better to irrigation and benefit from fertilizer--provided that opportunity. In 1966, India imported eleven million tons of grain. Today, it produces more than two hundred million tons, much of it for export. Between 1950 and the end of the twentieth century, the world's grain production rose from seven hundred million tons to 1.9 billion, all on nearly the same amount of land.

"It would have been a different planet, smaller, poorer, and far more agrarian." Adamchack runs an organic farm in Northern California, and has served as the president of California Certified Organic Farmers. His wife, Pamela Ronald, is a professor of plant genetics at the University of California at Davis, and their book "Tomorrow's Table" was among the first to demonstrate the ways in which advanced technologies can combine with traditional farming to help feed the world. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 There is another perspective on the Green Revolution. Shiva believes that it destroyed India's traditional way of life. "Until the 1960s, India was successfully pursuing an agricultural development policy based on strengthening the ecological base of agriculture and the self-reliance of peasants," she writes in "The Violence of the Green Revolution." She told me that, by shifting the focus of farming from variety to productivity, the Green Revolution actually was responsible for killing Indian farmers. Few people accept that analysis, though, and more than one study has concluded that if India had stuck to its traditional farming methods millions would have starved. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 The Green Revolution relied heavily on fertilizers and pesticides, but in the nineteen-sixties little thought was given to the environmental consequences. Runoff polluted many rivers and lakes, and some of India's best farmland was destroyed. "At first, the Green Revolution was wonderful," Sahai told me. "But, without a lot of water, it could not be sustained, and it should have ended long before it did."

S. Swaminathan has called "an evergreen revolution," one that combines the most advanced science with a clear focus on sustaining the environment. Until recently, these have seemed like separate goals. For thousands of years, people have crossed sexually compatible plants and then chosen among their offspring for what seemed like desirable characteristics (sturdy roots, for example, or resistance to disease). Farmers learned how to make better plants and varieties, but it was a process of trial and error until the middle of the nineteenth century, when Gregor Mendel demonstrated that many of the characteristics of a pea plant were passed from one generation to the next according to predictable rules. That created a new science, genetics, which helped make breeding far more precise. Nearly all the plants we cultivate--corn, wheat, rice, roses, Christmas trees--have been genetically modified through breeding to last longer, look better, taste sweeter, or grow more vigorously in arid soil.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28Genetic engineering takes the process one step further. By inserting genes from one species into another, plant breeders today can select traits with even greater specificity. Bt cotton, for instance, contains genes from a bacterium, Bacillus thuringiensis, that is found naturally in the soil. The bacterium produces a toxin that targets cotton bollworm, a pest that infests millions of acres each year. Twenty-five per cent of the world's insecticides have typically been used on cotton, and many of them are carcinogenic. By engineering part of the bacterium's DNA into a cotton seed, scientists made it possible for the cotton boll to produce its own insecticide. Soon after the pest bites the plant, it dies.

But it has also prompted a rancorous debate over the consequences of that knowledge. Genetically modified products have often been advertised as the best way to slow the impact of climate change, produce greater yields, provide more nutrients in food, and feed the world's poorest people. Most of the transgenic crops on the market today, however, have been designed to meet the needs of industrial farmers and their customers in the West.

And they worry that pollen from genetically engineered crops will drift into the wild, altering plant ecosystems forever. Many people, however, raise an even more fundamental objection: crossing varieties and growing them in fields is one thing, but using a gene gun to fire a bacterium into seeds seems like a violation of the rules of life.

A Brahmin, she was raised in prosperity. Her father was a forestry official for the Indian government; her mother worked as a school inspector in Lahore, and, after Partition, when the city became part of Pakistan, she returned to India. In the nineteen- seventies, Shiva joined a women's movement that was determined to prevent outside logging companies from cutting down forests in the highlands of northern India. Their tactic was simple and, ultimately, successful: they would form a circle and hug the trees. Shiva was, literally, one of the early tree huggers.

"I was busy with quantum theory for my doctoral work, so I had no idea what was going on with the Green Revolution," she said. Shiva had studied physics as an undergraduate. We were sitting in a small cafe near the United Nations, where she was about to attend an agricultural forum. She had just stepped off the plane from New Delhi, but she gathered energy as she told her story. "In the late eighties, I went to a conference on biotechnology, on the future of food," she said. "There were no genetically modified organisms then. These people were talking about having to do genetic engineering in order to take patents. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 "They said the most amazing things," she went on. "They said Europe and the U.S. are too small a market. We have to have a global market, and that is why we need an intellectual-property-rights law." That meeting set her on a new trajectory. "I realized they want to patent life, and life is not an invention," she said. "They want to release G.M.O.s without testing, and they want to impose this order worldwide. I decided on the flight back I didn't want that world." She returned to India and started Navdanya, which in Hindi means "nine seeds." According to its mandate, the organization was created to "protect the diversity and integrity of living resources, especially native seed, and to promote organic farming and fair trade." Under Shiva's leadership, Navdanya rapidly evolved into a national movement. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 In contrast to most agricultural ecologists, Shiva remains committed to the idea that organic farming can feed the world. Owing almost wholly to the efforts of Shiva and other activists, India has not approved a single genetically modified food crop for human consumption. Only four African nations--South Africa, Burkina Faso, Egypt, and Sudan--permit the commercial use of products that contain G.M.O.s. Europe remains the epicenter of anti-G.M.O. advocacy, but recent polls show that the vast majority of Americans, ever more focussed on the connection between food, farming, and their health, favor mandatory labelling for products that are made with genetically modified ingredients. Most say they would use such labels to avoid eating those foods. For her part, Shiva insists that the only acceptable path is to return to the principles and practices of an earlier era. "Fertilizer should never have been allowed in agriculture," she said in a 2011 speech. "I think it's time to ban it. It's a weapon of mass destruction. Its use is like war, because it came from war."

Last year, Prince Charles, who keeps a bust of Shiva on display at Highgrove, his family house, visited her at the Navdanya farm, in Dehradun, about a hundred and fifty miles north of New Delhi. Charles, perhaps the world's best-known critic of modern life, has for years denounced transgenic crops. "This kind of genetic modification takes mankind into realms that belong to God and God alone," he wrote in the nineteen-nineties, when Monsanto tried to sell its genetically engineered seeds in Europe. Shiva, too, invokes religion in her assault on agricultural biotechnology. "G.M.O. stands for 'God, Move Over,' we are the creators now," she said in a speech earlier this year. Navdanya does not report its contributions publicly, but, according to a recent Indian government report, foreign N.G.O.s have contributed significantly in the past decade to help the campaign against adoption of G.M.O.s in India. In June, the government banned most such contributions. Shiva, who was named in the report, called it "an attack on civil society," and biased in favor of foreign corporations. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 Shiva maintains a savvy presence in social media, and her tweets, intense and dramatic, circulate rapidly among tens of thousands of followers across the globe. They also allow her to police the movement and ostracize defectors. The British environmentalist Mark Lynas, for example, stood strongly against the use of biotechnology in agriculture for more than a decade. But last year, after careful study of the scientific data on which his assumptions were based, he reversed his position. In a speech to the annual Oxford Farming Conference, he described as "green urban myths" his former view that genetically modified crops increase reliance on chemicals, pose dangers to the environment, and threaten human health. "For the record, here and up front, I apologize for having spent several years ripping up G.M. crops," he said. "I am also sorry that I . . . assisted in demonizing an important technological option which can be used to benefit the environment." Lynas now regards the assumption that the world could be fed solely with organic food as "simplistic nonsense."

"If you want to get your name splattered all over the Web, there's nothing like recanting your once strongly held beliefs," Jason Mark, the editor of Earth Island Journal, wrote. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 Perhaps nobody was more incensed by Lynas's conversion than Shiva, who expressed her anger on Twitter: "#MarkLynas saying farmers shd be free to grow #GMOs which can contaminate #organic farms is like saying #rapists shd have freedom to rape." The message caused immediate outrage. "Shame on you for comparing GMOs to rape," Karl Haro von Mogel, who runs Biology Fortified, a Web site devoted to plant genetics, responded, also in a tweet. "That is a despicable argument that devalues women, men, and children." Shiva tweeted back at once. "We need to move from a patriarchal, anthropocentric worldview to one based on #EarthDemocracy," she wrote. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 Shiva has a flair for incendiary analogies. Recently, she compared what she calls "seed slavery," inflicted upon the world by the forces of globalization, to human slavery. "When starting to fight for seed freedom, it's because I saw a parallel," she said at a food conference in the Netherlands. "That time, it was blacks who were captured in Africa and taken to work on the cotton and sugarcane fields of America. Today, it is all of life being enslaved. All of life. All species." 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 Shiva cannot tolerate any group that endorses the use of genetic engineering in agriculture, no matter what else the organization does, or how qualified its support. When I mentioned that Monsanto, in addition to making genetically engineered seeds, has also become one of the world's largest producers of conventionally bred seeds, she laughed. "That's just public relations," she said. She has a similarly low regard for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which has taken strong positions in support of biotechnology. Not long ago, Shiva wrote that the billions of dollars the foundation has invested in agricultural research and assistance poses "the greatest threat to farmers in the developing world." She dismisses the American scientific organizations responsible for regulating genetically modified products, including the Food and Drug Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the United States Department of Agriculture, as little more than tools of the international seed conglomerates. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 At times, Shiva's absolutism about G.M.O.s can lead her in strange directions. In 1999, ten thousand people were killed and millions were left homeless when a cyclone hit India's eastern coastal state of Orissa. When the U.S. government dispatched grain and soy to help feed the desperate victims, Shiva held a news conference in New Delhi and said that the donation was proof that "the United States has been using the Orissa victims as guinea pigs" for genetically engineered products. She also wrote to the international relief agency Oxfam to say that she hoped it wasn't planning to send genetically modified foods to feed the starving survivors. When neither the U.S. nor Oxfam altered its plans, she condemned the Indian government for accepting the provisions. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 On March 29th, in Winnipeg, Shiva began a speech to a local food- rights group by revealing alarming new information about the impact of agricultural biotechnology on human health. "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said that in two years the figure of autism has jumped from one in eighty-eight to one in sixty- eight," she said, referring to an article in USA Today. "Then they go on to say obviously this is a trend showing that something's wrong, and that whether something in the environment could be causing the uptick remains the million-dollar question. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 "That question's been answered," Shiva continued. She mentioned glyphosate, the Monsanto herbicide that is commonly used with modified crops. "If you look at the graph of the growth of G.M.O.s, the growth of application of glyphosate and autism, it's literally a one-to-one correspondence. And you could make that graph for kidney failure, you could make that graph for diabetes, you could make that graph even for Alzheimer's." 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 Hundreds of millions of people, in twenty-eight countries, eat transgenic products every day, and if any of Shiva's assertions were true the implications would be catastrophic. But no relationship between glyphosate and the diseases that Shiva mentioned has been discovered. Her claims were based on a single research paper, released last year, in a journal called Entropy, which charges scientists to publish their findings. The paper contains no new research. Shiva had committed a common, but dangerous, fallacy: confusing a correlation with causation. (It turns out, for example, that the growth in sales of organic produce in the past decade matches the rise of autism, almost exactly. For that matter, so does the rise in sales of high-definition televisions, as well as the number of Americans who commute to work every day by bicycle.) 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 Shiva refers to her scientific credentials in almost every appearance, yet she often dispenses with the conventions of scientific inquiry. She is usually described in interviews and on television as a nuclear physicist, a quantum physicist, or a world- renowned physicist. Most of her book jackets include the following biographical note: "Before becoming an activist, Vandana Shiva was one of India's leading physicists." When I asked if she had ever worked as a physicist, she suggested that I search for the answer on Google. I found nothing, and she doesn't list any such position in her biography. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 Shiva argues that because many varieties of corn, soybeans, and canola have been engineered to resist glyphosate, there has been an increase in the use of herbicides. That is certainly true, and in high enough amounts glyphosate, like other herbicides, is toxic. Moreover, whenever farmers rely too heavily on one chemical, whether it occurs naturally or is made in a factory, weeds develop resistance. In some regions, that has already happened with glyphosate--and the results can be disastrous. But farmers face the problem whether or not they plant genetically modified crops. Scores of weed species have become resistant to the herbicide atrazine, for example, even though no crops have been modified to tolerate it. In fact, glyphosate has become the most popular herbicide in the world, largely because it's not nearly so toxic as those which it generally replaces. The E.P.A. has labelled water unsafe to drink if it contains three parts per billion of atrazine; the comparable limit for glyphosate is seven hundred parts per billion. By this measure, glyphosate is two hundred and thirty times less toxic than atrazine. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 For years, people have been afraid that eating genetically modified foods would make them sick, and Shiva's speeches are filled with terrifying anecdotes that play to that fear. But since 1996, when the crops were first planted, humans have consumed trillions of servings of foods that contain genetically engineered ingredients, and have draped themselves in thousands of tons of clothing made from genetically engineered cotton, yet there has not been a single documented case of any person becoming ill as a result. That is one reason that the National Academy of Sciences, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the World Health Organization, the U.K.'s Royal Society, the French Academy of Sciences, the European Commission, and dozens of other scientific organizations have all concluded that foods derived from genetically modified crops are as safe to eat as any other food.

Conway is the former president of the Rockefeller Foundation and a professor at London's Imperial College. His book "One Billion Hungry: Can We Feed the World?" has become an essential text for those who study poverty, agriculture, and development.

"Truth be damned. People in the rich world love to dabble in a past they were lucky enough to avoid--you know, a couple of chickens running around with the children in the back yard. But farming is bloody tough, as anyone who does it knows. It is like those people who romanticize villages in the developing world. Nobody who ever lived in one would do that."

I drove east from Auran-gabad on rutted roadways, where the contradictions of modern India are always on display: bright-green pyramids of sweet limes, along with wooden trinkets, jewelry salesmen, cell-phone stands, and elaborately decorated water delivery trucks. Behind the stands were giant, newly constructed houses, all safely tucked away in gated communities. Regional power companies in that part of the country pay two rupees (about three cents) a kilogram for discarded cotton stalks, and, as I drove past, the fields were full of women pulling them out of the ground. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 Although India bans genetically modified food crops, Bt cotton, modified to resist the bollworm, is planted widely. Since the nineteen-nineties, Shiva has focussed the world's attention on Maharashtra by referring to the region as India's "suicide belt," and saying that Monsanto's introduction of genetically modified cotton there has caused a "genocide." There is no place where the battle over the value, safety, ecological impact, and economic implications of genetically engineered products has been fought more fiercely. Shiva says that two hundred and eighty-four thousand Indian farmers have killed themselves because they cannot afford to plant Bt cotton. Earlier this year, she said, "Farmers are dying because Monsanto is making profits--by owning life that it never created but it pretends to create. That is why we need to reclaim the seed. That is why we need to get rid of the G.M.O.s. That is why we need to stop the patenting of life."

She seemed to know that, but said that the only way I could understand the scale of the disaster would be to visit the region myself. She also proposed that I join the seed caravan in Europe and then travel with her to the Navdanya farm. We exchanged several logistical texts and e-mails, but by the time I got to Italy Shiva had stopped writing or responding to my messages. In Florence, where she spoke to me briefly as she walked to a meeting, she said that I could try to see her in New Delhi but she doubted that she would be free. When I arrived in India, one of her assistants told me that I should submit any questions in writing. I did, but Shiva declined to answer them. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 Shiva contends that modified seeds were created almost exclusively to serve large industrial farms, and there is some truth to that. But Bt cotton has been planted by millions of people in the developing world, many of whom maintain lots not much larger than the back yard of a house in the American suburbs. In India, more than seven million farmers, occupying twenty-six million acres, have adopted the technology. That's nearly ninety per cent of all Indian cotton fields. At first, the new seeds were extremely expensive. Counterfeiters flooded the market with fakes and sold them, as well as fake glyphosate, at reduced prices. The crops failed, and many people suffered. Shiva said last year that Bt-cotton-seed costs had risen by eight thousand per cent in India since 2002. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 In fact, the prices of modified seeds, which are regulated by the government, have fallen steadily. While they remain higher than those of conventional seeds, in most cases the modified seeds provide greater benefits. According to the International Food Policy Research Institute, Bt farmers spend at least fifteen per cent more on crops, but their pesticide costs are fifty per cent lower. Since the seed was introduced, yields have increased by more than a hundred and fifty per cent. Only China grows and sells more cotton.

That is not the case in India. The Farmers' Rights Act of 2001 guarantees every person the right to "save, use, sow, resow, exchange, share, or sell" his seeds. Most farmers, though, even those with tiny fields, choose to buy newly bred seeds each year, whether genetically engineered or not, because they insure better yields and bigger profits.

Dhoksal is about three hundred miles northeast of Mumbai, but it seems to belong to another century. It's dusty and tired, and by noon the temperature had passed a hundred degrees. The majority of local farmers travel to the market by bullock cart. Some walk, and a few drive. A week earlier, a local agricultural inspector told me, he had seen a cotton farmer on an elephant and waved to him. The man did not respond, however, because he was too busy talking on his cell phone.

The first thing that the cotton farmers I visited wanted to discuss, though, was their improved health and that of their families. Before Bt genes were inserted into cotton, they would typically spray their crops with powerful chemicals dozens of times each season. Now they spray once a month. Bt is not toxic to humans or to other mammals. Organic farmers, who have strict rules against using synthetic fertilizers or chemicals, have used a spray version of the toxin on their crops for years.

"Before Bt cotton came in, we used the other seeds," Rameshwar Mamdev told me when I stopped by his six-acre farm, not far from the main dirt road that leads to the village. He plants corn in addition to cotton. "My wife would spray," he said. "She would get sick. We would all get sick." According to a recent study by the Flemish Institute for Biotechnology, there has been a sevenfold reduction in the use of pesticide since the introduction of Bt cotton; the number of cases of pesticide poisoning has fallen by nearly ninety per cent. Similar reductions have occurred in China. The growers, particularly women, by reducing their exposure to insecticide, not only have lowered their risk of serious illness but also are able to spend more time with their children.

One concern is that their pollen will drift into the surrounding environment. Pollen does spread, but that doesn't happen so easily; producing new seeds requires a sexually compatible plant. Farmers can reduce the risk of contamination by staggering planting schedules, which insures that different kinds of plants pollinate at different times. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 There is a bigger problem: pests can develop resistance to the toxins in engineered crops. The bollworm isn't Bt cotton's only enemy; the plant has many other pests as well. In the U.S., Bt- cotton farmers are required to use a "refuge" strategy: they surround their Bt crops with a moat of plants that do not make Bt toxins. This forces pests that develop resistance to Bt cotton to mate with pests that have not. In most cases, they will produce offspring that are still susceptible. Natural selection breeds resistance; such tactics only delay the process. But this is true everywhere in nature, not just on farms. Treatments for infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and H.I.V. rely on a cocktail of drugs because the infection would quickly grow resistant to a single medication. Nevertheless, none of the farmers I spoke with in Dhoksal planted a refuge. When I asked why, they had no idea what I was talking about.

In 2011, an American filmmaker, Micha Peled, released "Bitter Seeds," which argues that Monsanto and its seeds have been responsible for the suicides of thousands of farmers. The film received warm recommendations from food activists in the U.S. "Films like this can change the world," the celebrity chef Alice Waters said when she saw it. As the journalist Keith Kloor pointed out earlier this year, in the journal Issues in Science and Technology, the farmer-suicide story even found its way into the scientific community. Last October, at a public discussion devoted to food security, the Stanford biologist Paul Ehrlich stated that Monsanto had "killed most of those farmers in India." Ehrlich also famously predicted, in the nineteen-sixties, that famine would strike India and that, within a decade, "hundreds of millions of people will starve to death." Not only was he wrong but, between 1965 and 1972, India's wheat production doubled.

Although many Indian farmers kill themselves, their suicide rate has not risen in a decade, according to a study by Ian Plewis, of the University of Manchester. In fact, the suicide rate among Indian farmers is lower than for other Indians and is comparable to that among French farmers. Plewis found that "the pattern of changes in suicide rates over the last fifteen years is consistent with a beneficial effect of Bt cotton for India as a whole, albeit perhaps not in every cotton-growing state."

The only commercial farmers in the United States without crop insurance are those who have a philosophical objection to government support. In India, if you fail you are on your own. Farmers all need credit, but banks will rarely lend to them. "We want to send our children to school," Pawar told me. "We want to live better. We want to buy equipment. But when the crop fails we cannot pay." In most cases, there is no choice but to turn to money lenders, and, in villages like Dhoksal, they are often the same people who sell seeds. The annual interest rate on loans can rise to forty per cent, which few farmers anywhere could hope to pay.

Sahai is not ideologically opposed to the use of genetically engineered crops, but she believes that the Indian government regulates them poorly. Nonetheless, she says that the Bt- suicide talk is exaggerated. "If you revoked the permit to plant Bt cotton tomorrow, would that stop suicides on farms?" she said. "It wouldn't make much difference. Studies have shown that unbearable credit and a lack of financial support for agriculture is the killer. It's hardly a secret."

But I neither saw nor heard anything that supported Vandana Shiva's theory that Bt cotton has caused an "epidemic" of suicides. "When you call somebody a fraud, that suggests the person knows she is lying," Mark Lynas told me on the phone recently. "I don't think Vandana Shiva necessarily knows that. But she is blinded by her ideology and her political beliefs. That is why she is so effective and so dangerous." Lynas currently advises the Bangladeshi government on trials it is conducting of Bt brinjal (eggplant), a crop that, despite several peer-reviewed approvals, was rejected by the environmental minister in India. Brinjal is the first G.M. food crop in South Asia. Shiva wrote recently that the Bangladeshi project not only will fail but will kill the farmers who participate.

Shiva has repeatedly said that the company should be tried for "ecocide and genocide." When I asked Monsanto's chairman, Hugh Grant, how he dealt with such charges, he looked at me and shook his head, slowly. "We are a science-based company," he said. "I feel very strongly that you need to be grounded in the science or you lose the drift."

"Obviously, I am an optimistic Scotsman," he said, in an accent that has been softened by many years in the U.S. "Or I would be doing something else for a living." Grant often stresses the need to develop crops that use less water--and has argued for years that G.M.O.s alone could never feed the world. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 Nonetheless, Monsanto has pursued the market for transgenic crops with a zeal that has sometimes troubled even proponents of the underlying science. "When G.M. technology was in its infancy, many people were concerned," Anne Glover, the chief scientific adviser to the president of the European Commission, said recently. Glover considers it unethical to ignore G.M. crops if other approaches have failed. "People are still concerned about G.M.," she said. "Most of them are uneasy not with the technology per se but, rather, with the business practices in the agrifood sector, which is dominated by multinational companies." She said that those companies need to do a much better job of communicating with their customers. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 Grant concedes the point. "For years, we would have said that we are a biotech company," he said. "We are so far down the food chain . . . we always felt that we were divorced from what ends up on the shelf. And we are not." He noted that, during the past fifty years, the connection between American farmers and their customers had become increasingly tenuous, but that had begun to change. "People may despise us," he said, "but we are all talking about the same issues now, and that is a change I welcome. Food and agriculture are finally part of the conversation." Grant told me that, in 2002, he had commissioned a study to explore the idea of changing the company's name. "It would have cost twenty-five million dollars," he said. "At the time, that seemed like a waste of money." He paused for a moment. "It was my call, and it was a big mistake."

Many academic scientists who don't work for Monsanto or any other large corporation are struggling to develop crops that have added nutrients and others that will tolerate drought, floods, or salty soil--all traits needed desperately by the world's poorest farmers. Golden Rice--enriched with vitamin A--is the best-known example. More than a hundred and ninety million children under the age of five suffer from vitamin-A deficiency. Every year, as many as half a million will go blind. Rice plants produce beta carotene, the precursor to vitamin A, in the leaves but not in the grain. To make Golden Rice, scientists insert genes in the edible part of the plant, too. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 Golden Rice would never offer more than a partial solution to micronutrient deficiency, and the intellectual-property rights have long been controlled by the nonprofit International Rice Research Institute, which makes the rights available to researchers at no cost. Still, after more than a decade of opposition, the rice is prohibited everywhere. Two economists, one from Berkeley and the other from Munich, recently examined the impact of that ban. In their study "The Economic Power of the Golden Rice Opposition," they calculated that the absence of Golden Rice in the past decade has caused the loss of at least 1,424,680 life years in India alone. (Earlier this year, vandals destroyed some of the world's first test plots, in the Philippines.)

"In Africa, the pests and diseases of agriculture are as devastating as human diseases," Gordon Conway, who is on the board of the African Agricultural Technology Foundation, told me. He added that the impact of diseases like the fungus black sigatoka, the parasitic weed striga, and the newly identified syndrome maize lethal necrosis- -all of which attack Africa's most important crops--are "in many instances every bit as deadly as H.I.V. and TB." For years, in Tanzania, a disease called brown-streak virus has attacked cassava, a critical source of carbohydrates in the region. Researchers have developed a virus-resistant version of the starchy root vegetable, which is now being tested in field trials. But, again, the opposition, led in part by Shiva, who visited this summer, has been strong. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 Maize is the most commonly grown staple crop in Africa, but it is highly susceptible to drought. Researchers are working on a strain that resists both striga and the African endemic maize-streak virus; there have also been promising advances with insect-resistant cowpea and nutritionally enriched sorghum. Other scientists are working on plants that greatly reduce the need for nitrogen fertilizers, and several that produce healthful omega-3 fatty acids. None of the products have so far managed to overcome regulatory opposition.

Pental, an elegant, soft- spoken man, is a professor of genetics and also one of the country's most distinguished scientists. "We made a mistake in hyper- propagandizing G.M. products, saying it was a technology that would sort out every problem," he began. "The hype has hurt us." Pental, who received his doctorate from Rutgers, has devoted much of his career to research on Brassica juncea, mustard seed. Mustard and canola, Brassica napus, share a common parent. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 Mustard is grown on six million hectares in India. There are parts of the country where farmers raise few other crops. "We have developed a line of mustard oil with a composition that is even better than olive oil," he said. "It has a lot of omega-3 in it, and that is essential for a vegetarian food"--not a minor consideration in a country with half a billion people who eat no meat. The pungency that most people associate with mustard has been bred out of the oil, which is also low in saturated fats. "It is a beautiful, robust system," he said, adding that there have been several successful trials of the mustard seed. "All our work was funded by the public. Nobody will see any profits; that was never our intention. It is a safe, nutritious, and important crop." It also grows well in dry soil. Yet it was made in a laboratory, and, two decades later, the seed remains on the shelf. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 Nearly twenty per cent of the world's population lives in India. But the country has only five per cent of the planet's potable water. "Every time we export one kilogram of basmati rice, we export five thousand kilograms of water," Pental said. "This is a suicidal path. We have no nutritional priorities. We are exporting millions of tons of soy meal to Asia. The Japanese feed it to cows. The nutritive value of what a cow is eating in Japan is more than what a human being eats in India. This has to stop." 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 Pental struggled to keep the disappointment out of his voice. "White rice is the most ridiculous food that human beings can cultivate," he said. "It is just a bunch of starch, and we are filling our bellies with it." He shrugged. "But it's natural," he said, placing ironic emphasis on the final word. "So it passes the Luddite test."

Monsanto, she said, had simply paid for false stories, and "now they control the entire scientific literature of the world." Nature, Science, and Scientific American, three widely admired publications, "have just become extensions of their propaganda. There is no independent science left in the world." 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 Monsanto is certainly rich, but it is simply not that powerful. Exxon Mobil is worth seven times as much as Monsanto, yet it has never been able to alter the scientific consensus that burning fossil fuels is the principal cause of climate change. Tobacco companies spend more money lobbying in Washington each year than Monsanto does, but it's hard to find scientists who endorse smoking. The gulf between the truth about G.M.O.s and what people say about them keeps growing wider. The Internet brims with videos that purport to expose the lies about genetically modified products. Mike Adams, who runs a popular Web site called Natural News, recently compared journalists who are critical of anti-G.M.O. activists such as Shiva to Nazi collaborators.

That fear is unquestionably sincere. Yet, as a walk through any supermarket would demonstrate, nearly every food we eat has been modi-fied, if not by genetic engineering then by more traditional cross-breeding, or by nature itself. Corn in its present form wouldn't exist if humans hadn't cultivated the crop. The plant doesn't grow in the wild and would not survive if we suddenly stopped eating it.

Surgeons routinely suture pig valves into the hearts of humans; the operation has kept tens of thousands of people alive. Synthetic insulin, the first genetically modified product, is consumed each day by millions of diabetics. To make the drug, scientists insert human proteins into a common bacteria, which is then grown in giant industrial vats. Protesters don't march to oppose those advances. In fact, consumers demand them, and it doesn't seem to matter where the replacement parts come from. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28 When Shiva writes that "Golden Rice will make the malnutrition crisis worse" and that it will kill people, she reinforces the worst fears of her largely Western audience. Much of what she says resonates with the many people who feel that profit-seeking corporations hold too much power over the food they eat. Theirs is an argument well worth making. But her statements are rarely supported by data, and her positions often seem more like those of an end-of-days mystic than like those of a scientist.

It would be far better if the world's foods contained an adequate supply of vitamins. It would also help the people of many poverty- stricken countries if their governments were less corrupt. Working roads would do more to reduce nutritional deficits than any G.M.O. possibly could, and so would a more equitable distribution of the Earth's dwindling supply of freshwater. No single crop or approach to farming can possibly feed the world. To prevent billions of people from living in hunger, we will need to use every one of them.

This new biotechnology industry, with its promises of medical progress and food for all, calls itself the "life science" industry. It is being vigorously promoted with minimal oversight and regulation by the U.S. government and other governments around the world, and the primary beneficiaries are investors and the multinational petrochemical/food and drug/industrial complex. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28This new technology employs various ways to introduce genetic material from one species into another. Genes from fish, insects, bacteria, and viruses are put into the plants we eat, and some human genes are inserted into plants and nonhuman animals. These methods of "gene splicing" and the novel life forms so created are being patented and put on the market without clear scientific evidence that they are safe. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28The development of the biotechnology industry took off in 1976 when Genentech Inc. in San Francisco became the first corporation formed to develop this technology. In 1980, the US. Supreme Court ruled that an oileating bacterium developed by a General Electric Company researcher for cleaning up oil spills could be patented. In this same year, scientists at Ohio University in Athens transferred human growth genes into mice to create the first transgenic animals. In 1982, the first genetically engineered (g.e.) pharmaceutical product (insulin) was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for human use; g.e. renin, an enzyme used to make cheese, was approved in 1990.

In 1990 the Bush administration set up the Competitiveness Council Biotechnology Working Group, headed by Vice President Dan Quayle, to essentially protect the emerging US. biotechnology industry from regulatory constraints in order to facilitate global market expansion. The Clinton administration was similarly probiotechnology, and ignored position papers and appeals by concerned scientists with the Environmental Protection Agency and FDA to proceed with caution because of potential adverse environmental and consumer health risks.

The current market for g.e. seeds is estimated at $2.5 billion and involves four major industrial crops: soybeans, corn (maize), cotton, and canola (rapeseed). Argentina, Canada, and the United States grow the most g.e. crops, with China possibly in fourth place. Monsanto's patented g.e. seed traits accounted for more than four-fifths of the world's 1999 harvest of g.e. crops. The government refuses to require labeling of such foods to uphold the consumers' right to know.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28It has been established that pesticides and herbicides cause a variety of health and environmental problems that were long denied or covered up until Rachel Carson's book Silent Spring was published in 1962. These chemicals cannot self-replicate, but many genetically engineered organisms can. These organisms-containing new gene constructs (variously recombinant DNA) that have not been present in any life form ever before-can multiply and quickly spread these genes into the natural world. Today there are thousands of varieties of g.e. organisms, ranging from microbes to mice and tomatoes to trees, many of which are internationally patented. The risks that these g.e. organisms pose may well outweigh their hoped-for benefit. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28Researchers have shown that recombinant DNA can pass from one organism and species to another, resulting in what I call "genetic pollution" of the life stream. Recombinant DNA-such as a novel construction of a virus in a g.e. crop-could combine with other viruses and mutate, causing new diseases in plants and animals, and have a half-life of maybe millions of years. Most g.e. crops contain so-called antibiotic "marker" genes, and many scientists fear that these could lead to even more widespread antibiotic resistance in bacteria that is already a serious public health concern, in part because of the use of antibiotics in livestock feed. This is because the marker genes carrying antibiotic resistance could be taken up by bacteria that would then become resistant to certain antibiotics.

It was a combination of technology enchantment, arrogance and greed, coupled with an incomplete science-based understanding and socioeconomic assessment of risks and benefits, costs, and consequences. The precautionary principle (which employs both ethics and science in making risk assessments) and the law of unforeseeable consequences were ignored because biotechnology advocates believed they had the power to improve nature-and with patent protection for new products, they could create market monopolies and profit royally. But now things are beginning to fall apart, especially in the agricultural biotechnology sector.

But if the g.e. corn in these products was not considered safe for people, then what about residues from this feed in the milk, eggs, fat, and flesh of "farm" animals fed such corn? Because of this logical connection between what livestock are fed and possible consumer risk from animal products, consumer groups in Britain are demanding that all such products be labeled to indicate whether or not the animals have been fed g.e. crops and related by products.

Critics lament that more animals than ever are being used in experiments that often cause much suffering and have more to do with profiting from, rather than preventing, disease. Mice with genetically engineered traits that lead to cancer, obesity, diabetes, and other disorders are regarded as high-fidelity models of analogous human diseases. But defective genes are not the sole cause of most human health problems, and from a more holistic medical perspective, the creation of these mouse "models" may not be as medically progressive as the advocates of transgenic mouse research claim. Now that scientists at the Oregon Regional Primate Research Center have created the first transgenic monkey, "ANDi" (who carries the fluorescence gene of a jellyfish), they hope to be able to soon produce monkeys with genes that cause Alzheimer's disease, breast cancer, hereditary blindness, and other ailments so new therapies and vaccines can be tested.

For instance, when I and others testified against FDA approval of g.e. bovine growth hormone (rBGH), it was evident that injected cows would suffer more from production-related diseases because of hyperstimulation by the hormone, and have various health problems such as mastitis (udder infections), which could put consumers at risk. It was not clear that the milk from these cows that contained higher levels of insulin-like growth factor (which is elevated in people suffering from breast and prostate cancer) was safe for humans. But the FDA, bowing to industry pressure, approved this product and refused public appeals to have all dairy products from treated cows appropriately labeled.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28A major concern with genetically engineered organisms is the well-recognized problem called pleiotropism, the multiple and often unforeseen effects of a single gene. Genetic alteration to increase growth in pigs, or to confer insect and herbicide resistance in corn and cotton, can have unforeseen pleiotropic effects. As a consequence, biotechnologists have turned pigs into cripples with abnormal growth, defective joints, and impaired immune systems. The insertion of foreign genes can also cause mutations, which can mean birth defects and serious health problems later in life. There may also be so-called "overexpression" of the foreign genes so that excessive amounts of a particular hormone (like growth hormone) or other protein are produced. In animals, this may cause abnormal development and result in new diseases, difficult to diagnose and treat. In plants, insertional mutations and gene overexpression may result in new toxins harmful to consumers.

The g.e. insect poison called Bt (for Bacillus thcerigiensis) may destroy soil mycorrhyzal fungi. Without these fungi, which grow naturally around roots, plants cannot get essential nutrients from the soil, resulting in sick plants with poor nutritional value.

The US. government accepts this substantial equivalence as a reason to allow g.e. foods, beverages, and supplements to be sold to the public without such products being labeled, and without prior safety tests being conducted. But attorney Andrew Kimbrell with the International Center for Technology Assessment-along with the Center for Food Safety, the Alliance for Biointegrity, and several individual plaintiffs including scientists, chefs, and religious leaders-has spearheaded a civil society initiative against the federal government to demand better accountability and a moratorium on further FDA approvals until more research is done to determine safety, more regulations are put in place, and appropriate labeling is instigated.

Nor can the economic, ecological, and public health costs of increased animal protein and fat consumption be ignored, especially because there is a growing body of evidence supporting the savings and benefits of reduced meat production and consumption. Vegans and vegetarians should be aware of the environmental and ethical ramifications of g.e. crops that may well outweigh the health concerns, and buy organically certified produce.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28The biotechnology industry is mounting a well-orchestrated public relations campaign to garner public trust and support. Universities, the government, and such prestigious institutions as the National Academy of Sciences and the Rockefeller Institute are endorsing agricultural biotechnology as the way to food security. They want the public to believe that g.e. food is safe and doesn't need to be labeled, and that this technology is the best, if not the only, way to feed the hungry world. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28Critics see this as a cover by multinational corporations that are engaged in genetic piracy, which entails stealing the genetic resources-the so-called intellectual property-of peasant farmers' seed varieties, and even the unique DNA of indigenous peoples. There is a veritable gene rush going on to find and patent commercially valuable genes. This is coupled with a concerted move by multinational corporations to monopolize agriculture, food production, and worldwide marketing through international patent protection and the WTO. The U.S. government even shares a patent that will make all farmers' seeds sterile. This socalled "terminator" gene technology would prevent farmers from being able to save the best seeds for the next season, and instead force them to buy new seeds every year. Pollen from such "terminator" crops could sterilize conventional crops, valuable indigenous and traditional varieties, and wild plant relatives. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28The U.S. government is aggressively seeking to force g.e. crops and food products on its own citizens and on foreign countries through its various State Department consular offices that encourage Third World governments to adopt U.S. agricultural production methods and products, including g.e. seeds. So what's to be done with this runaway technology that impacts our food, our health, the well-being of animals and the environment? The gene genie is now way out of the bottle, and we can't put it back. Even if the release of g.e. life forms stopped tomorrow, we may not know for decades, if ever, their full impact on the life stream and future of Earth's creation.

It results in a monolithic wasteland of genetic determinist mentality that is the beginning of the brave new world."

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28My hope is that the potential risks and adverse consequences of this new industry, already with its millions of acres of genetically engineered crops, trees, and millions of genetically engineered animals, will make us wake up and be more responsive to the needs of the planet, and of the poor. It may also help us become more aware of the biological significance and purpose of other species, especially the animals and those life forms in the soil whom we cannot see with the naked eye and upon whose well-being our own species depends.

Yale had not officially joined the association until 1879 because it was holding out for 11-man teams. Led by Camp, the rules committee soon cut the number of players per side from 15 to 11. The committee also reduced the size of the field to 110 by 53 yards. In addition, Camp instituted a type of scrimmage in which a player snapped the ball back by kicking it to the quarterback. In 1882 Camp also introduced the system of downs. (At first, a team had three plays, or downs, to advance the ball 5 yards or give up possession; the number of yards was changed to 10 in 1906, and the fourth down was added in 1912.) Tackling below the waist was legalized in 1888. Within a decade, concern about the increasing brutality of the game led some colleges to ban football. Mass plays, an offensive strategy that massed players on a single point of the defense-most famously in Harvard's flying wedge formationhad seriously injured nearly 180 players, including 18 who were killed. In 1905 U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt called on Harvard, Princeton, and Yale to help save the sport. Representatives of 13 eastern schools met at year-end and agreed on reforms. At a second meeting, attended by more than 60 schools, the group appointed a seven-member Football Rules Committee and set up the Intercollegiate Athletic Association, which five years later became the NCAA.

They also prohibited mass plays, and teammates were prohibited from locking arms to clear a path for their ballcarrier. To further minimize mayhem, they shortened the length of the game from 70 to 60 minutes and established the neutral zone, which separates the teams by the length of the ball before each play begins.

After Camp, one of the earliest trendsetters was Amos Alonzo Stagg, who coached at the University of Chicago from 1892 to 1932. Stagg originated many techniques, including the shifts of linemen and backs from one side to the other. His ends-back formation was considered the first of the mass plays.

(Pop) Warner had a 44-year coaching career that began at the University of Georgia in 1895. He introduced single- and double-wing systems of offense that dominated the sport for decades. The legendary Jim Thorpe played under Warner at Pennsylvania's Carlisle Indian Industrial School (see Thorpe, Jim).

He was a respected tactician, known for his contributions to the passing game and his refinement of the shift to the box formation. (See also Rockne, Knute.) His teams of 1919, 1920, 1924, 1929, and 1930 won every game they played. The famous backfield of the 1924 team (Harry Stuhldreher, Jim Crowley, Elmer Layden, and Don Miller) was nicknamed the Four Horsemen by sports columnist Grantland Rice.

We've seen the enemy and the murder of thousands of innocent, unsuspecting people. They recognize no barrier of morality. They have no conscience. The terrorists cannot be reasoned with. Witness the recent anthrax attacks through our Postal Service.

And that is the purpose of this legislation.

Under the most trying conditions, they are serving this country with excellence and often with bravery.

We're dealing with terrorists who operate by highly sophisticated methods and technologies, some of which were not even available when our existing laws were written. The bill before me takes account of the new realities and dangers posed by modern terrorists. It will help law enforcement to identify, to dismantle, to disrupt, and to punish terrorists before they strike.

Secondly, it gives intelligence operations and criminal operations the chance to operate not on separate tracks but to share vital information so necessary to disrupt a terrorist attack before it occurs.

And as importantly, we're changing the culture of our various agencies that fight terrorism. Countering and investigating terrorist activity is the number one priority for both law enforcement and intelligence agencies.

The existing law was written in the era of rotary telephones.

As of today, we'll be able to better meet the technological challenges posed by this proliferation of communications technology,

Law enforcement agencies have to get a new warrant for each new district they investigate, even when they're after the same suspect. Under this new law, warrants are valid across all districts and across all States.

Current statutes deal more severely with drug-traffickers than with terrorists. That changes today. We are enacting new and harsh penalties for possession of biological weapons. We're making it easier to seize the assets of groups and individuals involved in terrorism. The Government will have wider latitude in deporting known terrorists and their supporters. The statute of limitations on terrorist acts will be lengthened, as will prison sentences for terrorists.

"I thought OK, when the pills work and I get myself straightened out, I'll go back to taking nothing but my vitamins," she says. Seventeen years later, Singleton still pops a pill every day. During the brief intervals when she's gone off medication, or when the ones she was on stopped working, the depression returned with a vengeance.

Most satisfied patients claim they provide highly effective relief with few side effects.

"It's a big problem," acknowledges Donald Klein, M.D., professor of psychiatry at Columbia University and director of research at the New York State Psychiatric Institute. "There are no hard data on how many people actually discontinue treatment due to the sexual side effects; it largely depends on how they are handled by the specific doctor. Zoloft, for example, is short-acting and can be stopped for a couple of days, restoring sexual function for that period. Adding Wellbutrin to an SSRI is another way to restore libido. But not all doctors may try these adjustments; they may just say that's the price you have to pay."

It's not that the drugs are contraindicated for long-term use, it's just been impossible to conduct long-term studies. Americans move or drop out.

Kramer, M.D. "No one has really bridged that gap and figured out just what is appropriate for long-term treatment. It does seem that recurrences are prevented. On the other hand, do the medications lose their effectiveness? Are there long-term side effects? These are just not known."

The demon almost always returns at some point.

"Eighty percent of people who have had one episode will eventually have another one, one year or many years down the road."

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28So why not just stop the medication after one episode is cured and wait until the next one hits before resuming treatment? Kramer points to a phenomenon known as kindling: the more episodes you have, the worse they get--and the less stress it takes to trigger them. Anecdotal evidence also suggests that going on and off medications may increase the dose needed next time to achieve the same benefit as last time. In the long run, stopping and starting doesn't reduce overall drug exposure.

What antidepressants do is speed recovery by eliminating symptoms and enhancing motivation and energy.

However, half of these positive responses are a placebo effect. Thus, only a third of patients are truly responding to the specific drug.

Most people with depression, he says, can find relief with the first or second antidepressant they try. Only about 10% to 15% of patients, unipolar and bipolar, are truly resistant to treatment.

One of the most debated treatment dilemmas today is how to handle the persistent low-grade depression known as chronic dysthymia: does it merit long-term medication, or medication at all? Jesse Rosenthal, M.D., chief psychopharmacologist at Beth Israel Medical Center in New York City, suggests that the personal price paid by the chronically dysthymic can be as great as that paid by people with major depression, in terms of damaged relationships, poor work performance and overall low energy.

Some patients will run into so-called "poop-out"; the medications simply stop working after a while. There are no official data on the antidepressant poop-out rate, but experts estimate it at about 20%. According to Klein, poop-out is highly unlikely to occur before three or four months of treatment; after that, there is no saying whether or when it will. "Poop-out is not uncommon, but it's not the expectation" says Goodwin. "It is possible to keep taking these drugs indefinitely at the same dose and maintain the same level of relief."

Other factors that can dent a medication's apparent effectiveness are aging (which tends to worsen or change depressive symptoms), substance abuse, a co-existing medical illness and noncompliance, a big problem.

"They miss doses or just stop on their own," she says. It is not uncommon for patients to drop their medications after four months, although prevention of relapse is believed to warrant longer treatment. Some find the side effects too pesky. Others become overconfident because they feel so much better. "Once you recover," Judge explains, "you don't want to be reminded of those dark days and the only thing reminding you is this little pill."

Whereas older medications--so-called tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors--can be dangerous at high doses, amounts of the SSRIs can be doubled and then doubled again without harm, according to Peter Kramer. "Sometimes the patient ends up on a more complicated regimen to get the same effect," he says. "Or sometimes it's a matter of taking a person off one drug and reintroducing it later. One way or another, it is mostly possible to get people back to where they were."

"My sense is that we're giving Prozac at too high a dose. Many people can do well with 10 mg, but 20 mg to 80 mg is common. Also, there's suspicion that the SSRIs may affect memory in the long run; it's hard to be sure because depression itself impairs memory."

Now, a team at the University of Virginia (UVA), USA - under the leadership of Dr Dan Engel, a virologist, and Dr Zygmunt Derewenda, a structural biologist - has obtained the crystal structure of a key protein involved in Ebola virus replication, the C-terminal domain of the Zaire Ebola virus nucleoprotein (NP) [Dziubanska et al. (2014). Acta Cryst. D70, 2420-2429; doi:10.1107/ S1399004714014710].

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28The team explains that their structure reveals a novel tertiary fold that is expected to lead to insights into how the viral nucleocapsid is assembled in infected cells. The structure could also provide a basis for the design of drugs to halt infection in humans. "The structure is unique in the RNA virus world," Derewenda explains. "It is not found in viruses that cause influenza, rabies or other diseases." It distantly resembles the beta-grasp protein motif found in ubiquitin, most likely the result of convergent evolution. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28Like many other related viruses, Ebola virus contains a negative- sense, single-stranded RNA that encodes seven different proteins, one of which is known as the nucleoprotein (NP) for its ability to interact with the viral RNA genome. It is the most abundant viral protein found in infected cells and also inside the viral nucleocapsid. While five of the seven viral proteins have succumbed to structural characterization by X-ray crystallography, NP so far has resisted such attempts, although analogous proteins from other viruses have had their structures analysed.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28The UVA team produced the Ebola protein using an engineered form of Escherichia coli bacteria as a protein factory. This allowed them to identify the boundaries of two globular domains and to crystallize the unique C-terminal domain spanning amino-acid residues 641 to 739. The study revealed a molecular architecture unseen so far among known proteins, the team says. There is existing evidence that the newly characterized domain is involved in transcription and the self-assembly of the viral nucleocapsid. As such, the results obtained by the UVA team will be useful in deciphering precisely how these various functions are accomplished by the virus; such a detailed description offers up a potential target for the design of anti-viral drugs.

Here the long sleep is replaced with 10 to 15 naps lasting 20 or 30 minutes, dispersed through the day.

In these circumstances, polyphasic sleep produces as much total slow-wave sleep as monophasic, he says. And he suggests that for people who are sleep-deprived, polyphasic sleep may actually be superior to one long sleep because it "recharges the batteries" so frequently. "It's easier than we expected to adapt to," says Stampi. "Some people actually seem to like it."

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28For most people, however, polyphasic sleep is neither necessary nor desirable. Most of us can fit in a reasonably long stretch of shut-eye. But if our sleep is too short or too interrupted, it can be useful to top it up with brief daytime naps that boost immediate performance.

The way you feel when you wake up varies dramatically depending on what stage of sleep you were in at the time. People woken while in slow-wave sleep feel groggy, a phenomenon known as sleep inertia, and this may take up to half an hour to shake off. People usually wake naturally in a light phase of sleep, and become alert more quickly.

Articles represent a wide range of reporting practices and opinions. This website is the only aggregation of what the African media - plus hundreds of NGOs, businesses and other institutions whose content appears - are saying about everything from sport and fashion to the most critical issues of the day. The opinion piece below quickly became a 'most read' on our site and gave us pause - given the advice of experts that in a public health emergency, conspiracy theories can kill. Contractually, we can only remove articles from content partners under certain, defined circumstances, including 'hate speech'. Sometimes, even unpopular opinions or false reporting are important to see.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28I disagree with those that have described Patrick Sawyer, the Liberian/American that single-handedly brought the deadly ebola virus into our shores, as a madman. He was not mad at all but just evil. He was a man that was on a mission. That mission was to spread the ebola virus to Nigeria and to infect and kill as many people as possible with it. He was an evil man with an evil intention and purpose. Worst still, he was not working alone. Some people, and I mean rich, powerful and well-connected people, were working with him. As a matter of fact, they sent him on the mission. They cultivated him, took care of him, paid him, brainwashed him, gave him all that he wanted in life and finally asked him to go on a suicide mission to destroy the lives of others and spread the deadly disease.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28This was a clear case of bio-terrorism and Sawyer was simply a pawn in a bigger game and a wider picture. The motive of those who sent him was to spread fear and panic, to kill as many people as possible, to create a need for a solution to the problem, to prepare the ground for a new wonder drug that could cure Ebola, to create a massive market for that drug and to ensure that there would be massive profits from it's sale. As usual, it is the unbelieving, unprepared, undiscerning and naive Africans that have been used as the prime guinea pigs in this satanic venture. When will they stop destroying us and treating us with such contempt? When will they begin to see and treat us as human beings? I guess the answer to that is when we cultivate the courage to stand up and say "no more" and when we have the good fortune of being blessed with a ruling elite and a political class that truly cares and that is incisive, insightful, properly educated, enlightened and historically literate.

They wrote the following: "The epidemic of the deadly Ebola virus that was born in the depths of the jungle, has been spreading around the world with an unprecedented speed lately. The number of victims, according to official figures, has already exceeded a thousand people. The number of infected individuals nears almost two thousand. The WHO declared the disease a threat of global significance. Are there ways to combat the fever? It turns out that there is a vaccine against Ebola. Pentagon scientists were developing it for 30 years, and all the rights for the drug belong to the government of the United States. Two infected US medics received injections of the vaccine and they started recovering from the disease immediately. Why was this made public only now? Why is it that the USA holds all the rights for the use of the vaccine? There can be two most obvious answers found to these questions. As one can see, Ebola is a perfect biological weapon: it spreads quickly and gives nearly 100 percent mortality. Those having the life-saving vaccine can dictate any conditions to others. The second answer is a purely commercial interest. It is enough to arrange panic with the help of the media, as it was the case with several epidemics before, such as avian flu. Afterwards, it will be possible to sell the life-saving medicine "at any price".

Yet, even though many may harbour deep suspicions about the role of the United States of America in this ugly episode and even though many may finger her, and indeed the entire western world, as being the sole culprits and co-conspirators behind the creation and unleashing of the Ebola virus on Africa, in my view, this may not necessarily be the case. I say this because even though the majority of the leading players in this small and exclusive club from hell that is known as the Illuminati and that are involved in this strange narrative are undoubtedly from America and western Europe. It is by no means an exclusive club of solely Americans and western Europeans. As a matter of fact, some leading and well-known third world and African leaders and business people are also deeply involved even though they may not rank too high up on the ladder or in the pecking order. Before anyone gets swept away with the idea that this is all about the evils of America, we must make it clear that the American people themselves, as opposed to their leaders, are as much of a victim of this secret cabal of wickedness as is anyone else. They are also wallowing in the throes of abysmal ignorance about what is really going on behind the scenes almost as much as the average African.

The forces that are behind this evil are well beyond America and they are inflicting as much evil on America, and indeed the entire western world, as they are on the rest of humanity. Africa and the African people are not their only victims and they are not their only prey. They prey on all of humanity and they feed on the flesh and drink the blood of us all regardless of where we come from. The roots of these forces are ancient and they are very real.

They are known as the "Illuminati" (meaning "The Enlightened Ones") and their activities are buried in absolute secrecy. Their symbol and operational structure is the pyramid and they are fortified, strengthened and protected by numerous ancient cults and fraternities, secret societies, false religions, pagan rituals, the control of the worlds banking system and money supply and the total domination and control of world politics and the entire world system itself. They are empowered directly, through a very complex and strict hierarchical system and command and control structure, by satan himself through his human agents and demons. Their ultimate goal and objective is to establish what has been rightly described by many commentators over the years as a "New World Order" which will be run by a "One World Government" that will be headed by the evil soul that the Holy Bible describes as "the beast", the "son of perdition" and the "Anti-Christ". The Koran describes the same individual as the "Masih Ad-Dajal". Everything that is going on in the world today, including the carnage and bestiality of the numerous conflicts and wars that we are witnessing are silently being orchestrated by them.

They are relentless, disciplined, purposeful, unyielding, ruthless, demonic, sociopathic, inhuman, committed, focused and very clear-thinking. Their ultimate goal is to enslave humanity, to enthrone the rulership of satan and his agents here on earth, to deny God His rightful place in the hearts and minds of His children, to destroy all His people and all men and women of faith that refuse to bow to their perverse values and to compel humanity to accept their "humanist" and ungodly philosophies and ways. These are the facts and anyone that does not believe that such an agenda or such a group exists needs to do a lot more reading, praying and research. The fact is that their greatest source of strength and pleasure is the erroneous enunciation of the absurd notion that they do not exist. They want us all to believe that there is no such evil force and organisation and that there is no such hidden agenda. Yet sadly they do exist and they not only control much of the world's economy, media and commerce but they also, through the process of subtle manipulation and sheer guile, install governments, prime ministers and presidents in the most powerful nations in the world and they tell them what to do from behind the scenes.

Between them these thirteen families, together with their underlings, fronts and associates, control virtually all the political power and money in the world. Whether anyone chooses to believe it or not, the truth is that they are not entirely human and they are utterly cold-blooded. One of those families is the Rothschild family (which literally means the "Red Shield"). I leave readers to do their own research on these families and to find out their links to the Illuminati. I suggest that they start by reading the numerous works of Mr. David Icke, an utterly brilliant man that has been described by his detractors as "the world's leading conspiracy theorist".

Both literally and figuratively, Michael Jordan soared higher than any National Basketball Association (NBA) guard before him. His high-leaping slam dunks inspired his nickname, Air Jordan. He was the NBA's top scorer for a record-breaking 10 seasons. Also outstanding at defense, Jordan was one of the greatest all-around players in the history of the game. He led the Chicago Bulls to six championships in the 1990s. He was considered the most recognizable athlete in the world at the time, and his long list of product endorsements reflected his popularity.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28Michael Jeffrey Jordan was born on Feb. 17, 1963, in Brooklyn, N.Y., but he grew up in Wilmington, N.C. He enjoyed playing several sports as a boy. Although he was cut from the varsity basketball team in his sophomore year of high school, he later became one of the team's star players. Jordan earned a scholarship to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, playing on the school's basketball team from his freshman year. In both his sophomore and junior years, he was named the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) college player of the year. After his junior year he left to join the NBA (though he later returned to earn his bachelor's degree, in 1986).

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-28Jordan was the third player chosen overall in the 1984 NBA draft, selected by the Chicago Bulls. The 6-foot 6-inch (1.98-meter) guard quickly demonstrated the wisdom of their choice. In his first season he averaged 28.2 points per game and was named the NBA's rookie of the year. Wilt Chamberlain was the only other player to score 3,000 points in a season before Jordan did it in the 198687 season. Jordan won seven consecutive scoring titles from the 198687 season through the 199293 season. He led the Bulls to three consecutive NBA championships, in 1991, 1992, and 1993. He also led the U.S. basketball team to a gold medal in both the 1984 and 1992 Olympic Games.

In 1994 he signed on to play for a minor league baseball team, but after one season he decided to return to basketball. He rejoined the Bulls late in their 199495 season. After leading the team to three more back-to-back championships in 1996, 1997, and 1998, Jordan retired for the second time in January 1999.

But he soon wanted to return to the court. He gave up his ownership and management positions with the Wizards in September 2001 in order to play on the team. In the 200203 season he became the first player in NBA history age 40 years or older to score more than 40 points in a game. Jordan's final retirement from basketball came in May 2003.

The emotional and physical experiences of stress can be caused by a complex and tense situation. Under stress, the body makes rapid physiological changes, called adaptive responses, to deal with threatening situations. In the first stage of stress, alarm, the body mobilizes its Âfight or flightÂ defenses, either to resist the stress-causing factor or adapt to it. In this stage, the pituitary-adrenocortical system pours hormones into the bloodstream. The pulse quickens, the lungs take in more oxygen to fuel the muscles, blood sugar increases to supply added energy, digestion slows, and perspiration increases.

If the stressful situation is resolved, the stress symptoms vanish. If the stressful situation continues, however, a third stage, exhaustion, sets in, and the body's adaptive energy runs out. This stage may continue until vital organs are affected, and then disease or even death can result.

People with type-A behavior react to stress with aggressiveness, competitiveness, and self-imposed pressure to get things done. Type-A behavior has been linked to increased rates of heart attack and other diseases. In the United States two of every three men and one of every two women demonstrate type-A characteristics. People with type-B behavior may be equally serious in their intentions, but are more patient, easygoing, and relaxed.

The Holmes-Rahe ÂSocial Readjustment Rating ScaleÂ ranks a number of life events in order of their estimated level of stress.

Stress-related disorders compose 50 to 80 percent of all illnesses, though stress may not be the only cause. Such disorders include high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, arthritis and other inflammatory diseases, asthma, insomnia and other sleep disturbances, and anorexia nervosa and other eating disorders. Stress is also related to migraine headaches, ulcers, respiratory or lung diseases, and skin disturbances. (See also disease, human; emotion; health.) Although a link between stress and cancer is uncertain, some experts believe there is a type-C personalityÂone who is cancer prone because of chronic stress.

They suggest the following ways to manage stress: (1) Have a code of life and live positively. (2) Set priorities to avoid unnecessary time pressures. (3) Allow time for pleasurable activities such as taking walks or talking with friends. (4) Exercise regularly as an outlet for stress. (5) Eat a sensible diet to maintain the energy needed to cope with stress. (6) Learn self-relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, muscle relaxation, and meditation.

In the study, 148 obese adults were told either to cut down on saturated fats (such as meat, whole milk and butter) or high-carb foods (white bread, sugary cereals and other processed foods). The groups didn't have calorie restrictions, but both reported cutting back by between

They also, more unexpectedly, had better cholesterol levels, a greater reduction in body fat and a higher proportion of lean muscle mass. As often happens in such diets, the low-carb group were found to have replaced the calories they would usually consume in sugary processed foods with cheese and red meat, but also with unsaturated fats such as fish and nuts. Both groups did the same amount of exercise. A low-carb diet was defined as less than 40g a day,

An impressive 80% of people said that they stuck to their diets for the whole year. But, as usual with these studies, this is but one piece of a dietary jigsaw.

After a year, this study found no difference in weight loss. It did not look at reductions in heart disease.

The answer - surprise, surprise - is that if you can stick to either type of diet, you'll lose weight.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-29Spotify is helping to revive the fortunes of the global music industry, reports Matthew Garrahan 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-29 At first glance, the recent annual report from the IFPI, the music trade body, made for grim reading. Global music sales were down 4 per cent in 2013, a depressing slip for an industry that had hoped to put a decade of decline behind it. But hidden in the report was a possible key to music's future. Income from streaming services rose 50 per cent to more than $1bn last year, a sign that music fans are moving from digitally downloading music to own in favour of an all-access subscription model. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-29 European music services such as Spotify are leading the innovation charge and record labels are, for the first time in more than a decade, looking to the future with optimism. Subscription music provides a steady and growing revenue stream, instead of a business model built around a cycle of releases by individual artists. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-29 "What the subscription model does is take volatility out of the record business," says Rob Wells, president of global digital business at Universal Music Group, the world's largest music company and home to artists ranging from Kanye West to the Rolling Stones. Subscription, he adds, "makes the industry more attractive to investors". 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-29 The picture was a lot less rosy in 2006 when Daniel Ek, Spotify's founder, was kicking around ideas for a streaming music service. The music market in Ek's native Sweden had been damaged by piracy and some of the biggest operators of pirated content, such as The Pirate Bay, were based in the country. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-29 Record labels and music services around the world had struggled to absorb the impact of piracy. Sales of CDs had fallen into inexorable decline while digital downloading, from sites such as iTunes, was popular but not growing fast enough to offset the slump. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-29 Ek envisaged a creative solution to beating the pirates at their own game - making music available for free on an ad-supporting streaming service that served to turn its users into longer-term, paying customers. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-29 "From the outset the notion was that to compete with piracy you have to be free [of charge] and when people fall in love with the service you can get them to pay," says Jonathan Forster, Spotify's managing director of the Nordics. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-29 The launch of the service in 2008 almost coincided with the launch of Apple's 3G iPhone model. The two services were tailor- made for each other: in tech-savvy Sweden, Spotify took off like a rocket and now represents more than 70 per cent of the country's total music revenues; in the UK, it will represent about a third of all music revenues by the end of this year. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-29 Other Nordic countries where Spotify launched have followed a similar trajectory and, as it has rolled out across the world, the expectation is that other markets - including the US - will follow suit in terms of subscription becoming the main way people listen to music. "It's only a matter of time; it's an absolute inevitability," says Wells. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-29 Spotify's most recent public figures reveal 24m users, of whom more than 6m are paying subscribers. Other streaming services have joined the fray, each catering for a different slice of the market. Wimp, which also hails from Sweden, is a paid-for service that offers streaming music in high-definition quality, for example, while other services have targeted more cost-conscious customers. Beats Music, which recently launched in the US, is targeting listeners who want a more curated, personalised service. The company was started by fabled record producer Jimmy Iovine, and hip-hop legend Dr Dre and has backing from billionaires such as Len Blavatnik and James Packer. "There's plenty of room for competition," says Wells. "All of these services are parked in different lanes." 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-29 Powered by the iPhone and a generation of listeners that were using mobile devices, Spotify quickly became the fastest-growing music service. When it launched in the US in 2010 it attracted 1m subscribers in its first 16 months, a milestone that took its rival, Rhapsody, 11 years to reach. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-29 The biggest obstacles it faced were ensuring its technology platform worked smoothly as well as convincing the record labels to do licensing deals. "The licensing was hard," says Forster. "I don't think anyone had done it on that scale before." 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-29 Spotify and its rivals are now centre stage in an industry that has undergone a dramatic transformation. As sales of CDs and full albums have declined and the industry has grappled with the transition to a digital downloading model, live music and performances have exploded. For top artists, global tours now represent a larger slice of their earnings than sales of recorded music. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-29 Cities and countries once deemed too remote for touring have now become mainstays on the global circuit for the biggest acts. Thanks to social media, the cost of promoting tours has fallen: concert promoters now rely on the biggest acts telling their fans where and when they will be appearing. Promoters can also plan tours using social media data to identify parts of the world where a particular artist may be popular. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-29 But for recorded music, subscription streaming and the proliferation of mobile devices show the way forward. Mobile networks eager to boost their credibility and reduce customer churn have signed deals with streaming services such as Deezer and Spotify, while Beats Music launched its service in the US on the back of a partnership with AT&T. Spotify, which has several mobile deals in Europe, recently struck its first deal in the US with Sprint, the mobile network controlled by SoftBank. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-29 With new distributors and creative thinking coming into an industry that has had a miserable decade, music has regained some of its swagger. "I firmly believe we can expand even beyond the glory days of the industry," says Wells. "We can make the music business bigger than it has ever been."

Through May, the toiletries and cosmetics category spent $909 million in magazines, a 16 percent increase compared to the same period a year prior, according to data from TNS Media Intelligence.

Allure through May garnered $33.5 million in advertising from cosmetics, a 15 percent rise compared to the same period last year, while pages through July have grown 8.8 percent to 776, reports the Mediaweek Monitor. Essence, meanwhile, earned $14.5 million, an 8 percent gain, though ad pages have have fallen 4.2 percent through July to 741. Moreover, other magazine categories, such as celebrity weeklies and women's service are seeing an uptick in beauty ads. For example, American Media Inc.'s Star now carries advertisers such as Pantene and Cover Girl.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/115/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-29As the category explodes, beauty companies have had to become savvier marketers to break through the clutter. But some have been basing their print buys on antiquated strategies and old-school reasoning. Recently, Essence and Allure unveiled new research that could help advertisers better reach both mass and targeted consumers-Essence dispelled myths and advised manufacturers how to court African American women in its latest Smart Beauty study of nearly 2,000 African American women, while Allure's annual Catalyst Report that surveyed 1,000 women (the pool mirrored the composition of the U.S. Census) revealed new research on how women shop for beauty products and respond to ads. By unearthing what language and print placements attract consumers, the findings from both camps could help beauty brands better plan more engaging advertising campaigns. The magazines' efforts, however, are in many ways self-serving. The hope is that these new marketing tools will be applied when buying ad pages in Allure and Essence.

While antiaging products have been a powerful catalyst for overall growth in beauty, African American titles have not fared as well as, say, Allure. According to Nancy Cardone, Allure's vp, publisher, skincare is the monthly's fastest growing category, helped by new youth-preserving products from the likes of Neutrogena and Clinique. "There's so much science and technology in the category right now," said Cardone. Moreover, the age at which women are buying the products is much younger. "Now they start in their twenties and think of it more as a way to prevent aging."

Kbanks contended that advertisers continue to buy into the myth that women of color do not age as quickly nor spend as much on beauty products. "The mass skincare marketers are speaking directly to women of color," said Ebanks. "Masstige skincare companies are not. The myth is that women of color don't care about aging. We don't wrinkle as early, but we care about it."

Most respondents in the Allure survey did not buy products because of celebrity plugs, but rather were driven by a special occasion, samples, magazine articles or recommendations from friends or family.

Results from the Essence survey also found that women of color often rely on recommendations from friends. Lorrie King, senior director, marketing for Baby Phat and Phat Farm fragrance, believed ads must be placed in targeted books to stay part of that conversation. "They may read everyone else-In Style, Vogue and Harper's Bazaar-but the magazines that their family and friends are talking about will most likely reside in their ethnic group," said King.

In addition to eyeing more strategic media placements, marketers also need to pay more attention to the language in print ads. Research from both Allure and Essence found that using certain words resonated better with women than others. Smart Beauty participants preferred words emphasizing natural or healthy benefits. They also responded better to language in ads or on product packaging that described their skin tone in flavors-honey, mocha, chocolate-versus light, medium or beige. Likewise, words like "natural" and "pretty" were more appreciated than "sexy" or "glamorous," according to Allure's Catalyst Report.

It was 1950, when public schools in Kansas-and 20 other states-were segregated.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/101/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30The schools reserved for blacks were often in shoddy buildings, with fewer textbooks, chairs, and basic supplies. In some places, classes were held in buses or one-room shacks. Topeka had only four elementary schools for blacks, compared with 18 for whites. So while Linda's white neighborhood friends could walk to Sumner, she had to walk six blocks, then take a half-hour bus ride to get to the closest school for blacks.

Their five cases were eventually folded into one case that went all the way to the Supreme Court: Brown v. Board of Education.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/101/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30Brown was a total reversal of the Supreme Court's position on segregation. In 1896 in Plessy v. Ferguson, which involved segregation on trains, the Court established the doctrine of "separate but equal" that served as the legal underpinning for segregation (see Timeline, p. 18). Blacks and whites throughout the U.S. often lived in separate neighborhoods and attended separate schools. But in most of the South, state and local laws required separation of the races in transportation, restaurants, movie theaters, and schools.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/101/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30In the 1930s, the NAACP began its fight to end segregation in education. It first challenged segregation at colleges and graduate schools, where it was thought there would be less resistance to change. NAACP lawyers, including Thurgood Marshall-who became the first black justice of the Supreme Court in 1967-won several cases that helped establish the legal framework Marshall would rely on in Brown.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/101/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30A few years before the 1954 Brown decision, nearly 200 men, women, and children, aided by the NAACP, challenged school segregation in Kansas, Delaware, Virginia, South Carolina, and Washington, D.C.- often at great risk to themselves. Some received death threats from the Ku Klux Klan, lost their jobs, or suddenly found they could no longer shop on credit. Their cases were later rolled into Brown.

When it first began its fight against segregation, the NAACP didn't challenge Plessy headon; instead, it argued that blacks actually weren't getting an equal education. But in Brown, lawyers attacked Plessy directly: With testimony from psychologists and sociologists, they argued that separate could never be equal because segregation hurt black children's self-esteem, development, and ability to learn-violating their 14th Amendment right to "equal protection of the laws."

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/101/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30Marshall was essentially asking the Court to reverse its own 60-year-old precedent, something it had historically been reluctant to do.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/101/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30But Chief Justice Earl Warren, a former governor of California appointed to the Supreme Court by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1953, felt the time was right. He also knew that overturning Plessy would create a firestorm, especially in the South, which considered segregation an issue of states' rights and not the federal government's business. So Warren worked behind the scenes to secure a unanimous Brown decision, which would make it harder to criticize.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/101/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30Seizing on the Court's vague instructions to proceed toward desegregation "with all deliberate speed," many school districts moved slowly, if at all. Many shut down public schools for years rather than integrate, instead financing private schools-which were unaffected by Brownfor white students. In 1958, Virginia adopted a policy of "massive resistance," a series of laws that denied funds to integrated public schools.

In fact, from 1970 to 2004, schools in the South were more integrated than in the rest of the U.S., according to Gary Orfield, co-director of the Civil Rights Project at UCLA.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/101/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30But today, 60 years after Brown, many schools in the U.S. are segregated in practice, if not by law. The American Sociological Review reported last year that more than 40 percent of black and Latino students in 2009-10 went to schools that were 90 percent to 100 percent minority, and most attended schools that were more than 50 percent minority.

"We have segregated schools [today partly] because we still have neighborhood segregation. ... It raises different kinds of questions about who Americans are and how they understand themselves as citizens of a common country."

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/101/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30Still, the Brown decision helped energize the civil rights movement. A year and a half later, Rosa Parks refused to move to the back of a bus in Montgomery, Alabama, leading to a bus boycott that would help desegregate the city's buses. Peaceful marches, sit-ins, and boycotts led by Martin Luther King Jr. and others in the 1950s and 1960s led to more progress on civil rights (see box). According to Finkelman, the law professor, it can all be traced to the Supreme Court's 1954 ruling.

In summer, when the sun returns for its six-monthlong day, the glacial terrain hardly becomes more inviting, with temperatures climbing to minus 20 degrees. Not the kind of place most of us would choose to visit.

It's the premier place to practice your trade. With the coldest and driest air on earth, the atmosphere lets photons travel virtually unimpeded, providing the sharpest terrestrial-based space images ever taken.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/103/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30For three years, a team of as- tronomers led by Harvard-Smithsonian researcher John Kovac braved the elements to point a brawny telescope known as Bicep2 (an acronym for the less euphonious Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization) at a patch of the southern sky. In March, the team released its results. Should the conclusions stand, they will open a spectacular new window on the earliest moments of the universe, and will deservedly rank among the most important cosmological findings of the past century.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/103/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30It's a story whose roots can be traced back to early creation stories intended to satisfy the primal urge to grasp our origins. But I'll pick up the narrative later-with Albert Einstein's discovery of the general theory of relativity, the mathematical basis of space, time and all modern cosmological thought.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/103/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30Warped Space to the Big Bang

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/103/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30In the early years of the 20th century, Einstein rewrote the rules of space and time with his special theory of relativity. Until then, most everyone adhered to the Newtonian perspective-the intuitive perspective-in which space and time provide an unchanging arena wherein events take place. But as Einstein described it, in the spring of1905 a storm broke loose in his mind, a torrential downpour of mathematical insight that swept away Newton's universal arena. Einstein argued convincingly that there is no universal time-clocks in motion tick more slowly-and there is no universal space-rulers in motion are shorter. The absolute and unchanging arena gave way to a space and time that were malleable and flexible.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/103/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30Fresh off this success, Einstein then turned to an even steeper challenge. For well over two centuries, Newton's universal law of gravity had done an impressive job at predicting the motion of everything from planets to comets. Even so, there was a puzzle that Newton himself articulated: How does gravity exert its influence? How does the Sun influence the Earth across some 93 million miles of essentially empty space? Newton had provided an owner's manual allowing the mathematically adept to calculate the effect of gravity, but he was unable to throw open the hood and reveal how gravity does what it does.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/103/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30In search of the answer, Einstein engaged in a decade-long obsessive, grueling odyssey through arcane mathematics and creative flights of physical fancy. By 1915, his genius blazed through the final equations of the general theory of relativity, finally revealing the mechanism underlying the force of gravity.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/103/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30The answer? Space and time. Already unshackled from their Newtonian underpinnings by special relativity, space and time sprung fully to life in general relativity. Einstein showed that much as a warped wooden floor can nudge a rolling marble, space and time can themselves warp, and nudge terrestrial and heavenly bodies to follow the trajectories long ascribed to the influence of gravity.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/103/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30However abstract the formulation, general relativity made definitive predictions, some of which were quickly confirmed through astronomical observations. This inspired mathematically oriented thinkers the world over to explore the theory's detailed implications. It was the work of a Belgian priest, Georges Lemaître, who also held a doctorate in physics, that advanced the story we're following. In 1927, Lemaître applied Einstein's equations of general relativity not to objects within the universe, like stars and black holes, but to the entire universe itself. The result knocked Lemaître back on his heels. The math showed that the universe could not be static: The fabric of space was either stretching or contracting, which meant that the universe was either growing in size or shrinking.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/103/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30When Lemaître alerted Einstein to what he'd found, Einstein scoffed. He thought Lemaître was pushing the math too far. So certain was Einstein that the universe, as a whole, was eternal and unchanging, that he not only dismissed mathematical analyses that attested to the contrary, he inserted a modest amendment into his equations to ensure that the math would accommodate his prejudice.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/103/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30And prejudice it was. In 1929, the astronomical observations of Edwin Hubble, using the powerful telescope at Mount Wilson Observatory, revealed that distant galaxies are all rushing away. The universe is expanding. Einstein gave himself a euphemistic slap in the forehead, a reprimand for not trusting results coming out of his own equations, and brought his thinking-and his equations-into line with the data.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/103/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30Great progress, of course. But new insights yield new puzzles.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/103/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30As Lemaître had pointed out, if space is now expanding, then by winding the cosmic film in reverse we conclude that the observable universe was ever smaller, denser and hotter ever further back in time. The seemingly unavoidable conclusion is that the universe we see emerged from a phenomenally tiny speck that erupted, sending space swelling outward-what we now call the Big Bang.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/103/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30But if true, what sent space swelling? And how could such an outlandish proposal be tested?

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/103/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30If the universe emerged from a sweltering hot and intensely dense primeval atom, as Lemaître called it, then as space swelled the universe should have cooled off. Calculations undertaken at George Washington University in the 1940s, and later at Princeton in the 1960s, showed that the Big Bang's residual heat would manifest as a bath of photons (particles of light) uniformly filling space. The temperature of the photons would now have dropped to a mere 2.7 degrees above absolute zero, placing their wavelength in the microwave part of the spectrum-explaining why this possible relic of the Big Bang is called the cosmic microwave background radiation.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/103/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30In 1964, two Bell Labs scientists, Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson, were at wits' end, frustrated by a large ground-based antenna designed for satellite communications. Regardless of where they pointed the antenna, they encountered the audiophile's nightmare: an incessant background hiss. For months they sought but failed to find the source. Then, Penzias and Wilson caught wind of the cosmological calculations being done at Princeton suggesting there should be a low-level radiation filling space. The incessant hiss, the researchers realized, was arising from the Big Bang's photons tickling the antenna's receiver. The discovery earned Penzias and Wilson the 1978 Nobel Prize.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/103/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30The prominence of the Big Bang theory skyrocketed, impelling scientists to pry the theory apart, seeking unexpected implications and possible weaknesses. A number of important issues were brought to light, but the most essential was also the most basic.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/103/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30The Big Bang is often described as the modern scientific theory of creation, the mathematical answer to Genesis. But this notion obscures an essential fallacy: The Big Bang theory does not tell us how the universe began. It tells us how the universe evolved, beginning a tiny fraction of a second after it all started. As the rewound cosmic film approaches the first frame, the mathematics breaks down, closing the lens just as the creation event is about to fill the screen. And so, when it comes to explaining the bang itself-the primordial push that must have set the universe headlong on its expansionary course-the Big Bang theory is silent.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/103/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30It would fall to a young postdoctoral fellow in the physics department of Stanford University, Alan Guth, to take the vital step toward filling that gap. Guth and his collaborator Henry Tye of Cornell University were trying to understand how certain hypothetical particles called monopoles might be produced in the universe's earliest moments. But calculating deep into the night of December 6,1979, Guth took the work in a different direction. He realized that not only did the equations show that general relativity plugged an essential gap in Newtonian gravityproviding gravity's mechanismthey also revealed that gravity could behave in unexpected ways. According to Newton (and everyday experience) gravity is an attractive force that pulls one object toward another. The equations were showing that in Einstein's formulation, gravity could also be repulsive.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/103/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30The gravity of familiar objects, such as the Sun, Earth and Moon, is surely attractive. But the math showed that a different source, not a clump of matter but instead energy embodied in a field uniformly filling a region, would generate a gravitational force that would push outward. And ferociously so. A region a mere billionth of a billionth of a billionth of a centimeter across, filled with the appropriate energy field-called the inflaton field-would be wrenched apart by the powerful repulsive gravity, potentially stretching to as large as the observable universe in a fraction of a second.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/103/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30And that would rightly be called a bang. A big bang.

A credible proposal for what ignited the outward swelling of space was finally on the theorists' table. But is it right?

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/103/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30At first blush, it might seem a fool's errand to seek confirmation of a theory that ostensibly operated for a tiny fraction of a second nearly 14 billion years ago. Sure, the universe is now expanding, so something set it going in the first place. But is it even conceivable to verify that it was sparked by a powerful but brief flash of repulsive gravity?

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/103/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30It is. And the approach makes use, once again, of the microwave background radiation.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/103/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30To get a feel for how, imagine writing a tiny message, too small for anyone to read, on the surface of a deflated balloon. Then blow the balloon up. As it stretches, your message stretches too, becoming visible. Similarly, if space experienced dramatic inflationary stretching, then tiny physical imprints set down during the universe's earliest moments would be stretched across the sky, possibly making them visible too.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/103/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30Is there a process that would have imprinted a tiny message in the early universe? Quantum physics answers with a resounding yes. It comes down to the uncertainty principle, advanced by Werner Heisenberg in 1927. Heisenberg showed that the microworld is subject to unavoidable "quantum jitters" that make it impossible to simultaneously specify certain features, such as both the position and the speed of a particle. For fields suffusing space, the uncertainty principle shows that a field's strength is also subject to quantum jitters, causing its value at each location to jiggle up and down.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/103/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30Decades of experiments on the microrealm have verified that the quantum jitters are real and ubiquitous; they're unfamiliar only because the fluctuations are too tiny to be directly observed in everyday life. Which is where the inflationary stretching of space comes into its own.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/103/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30Much as with your message on the expanding balloon, if the universe underwent the stupendous expansion proposed by the inflationary theory, then the tiny quantum jitters in the inflaton field-remember, that's the field responsible for repulsive gravity-would be stretched into the macroworld. This would result in the field's energy being a touch larger in some locations, and a touch smaller in others.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/103/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30In turn, these variations in energy would have an impact on the cosmic microwave background radiation, nudging the temperature slightly higher in some locations and slightly lower in others. Mathematical calculations reveal that the temperature variations would be small-about 1 part in 100,000. But-and this is key-the temperature variations would fill out a specific statistical pattern across the sky.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/103/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30Beginning in the 1990s, a series of ever more refined observational ventures-ground-, balloonand spacebased telescopes-have sought these temperature variations. And found them. Indeed, there is breathtaking agreement between the theoretical predictions and the observational data.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/103/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30And with that, you might think the inflationary approach had been confirmed. But as a community, physicists are about as skeptical a group as you will ever encounter. Over the years, some proposed alternative explanations for the data, while others raised various technical challenges to the inflationary approach itself. Inflation remained far and away the leading cosmological theory, but many felt the smoking gun had yet to be found.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/103/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30Just as fields within space are subject to quantum jitters, quantum uncertainty ensures that space itself should be subject to quantum jitters too. Which means that space should undulate like the surface of a boiling pot of water. This is unfamiliar for the same reason that a granite tabletop seems smooth even though its surface is riddled with microscopic imperfections-the undulations happen on extraordinarily tiny scales. But, once again, because inflationary expansion stretches quantum features into the macrorealm, the theory predicts that the tiny undulations sprout into far longer ripples in the spatial fabric. How would we detect these ripples, or primordial gravitational waves, as they are more properly called? For the third time, the Big Bang's ubiquitous relic, the cosmic microwave background radiation, is the ticket.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/103/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30Calculations show that gravitational waves would imprint a twisting pattern on the background radiation, an iconic fingerprint of inflationary expansion. (More precisely, the background radiation arises from oscillations in the electromagnetic field; the direction of these oscillations, known as the polarization, gets twisted in the wake of gravitational waves.) The detection of such swirls in the background radiation has long been revered as the gold standard for establishing the inflationary theory, the long sought smoking gun.

Perhaps the swirls had been found? At the press conference on March 17, the rumors were confirmed. After more than a year of careful analysis of the data, the Bicep2 team announced that it had achieved the first detection of the predicted gravitational wave pattern.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/103/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30The Bicep2 team has done a heroic job, but full confidence in its results will require confirmation by independent teams of researchers. We won't have to wait long. Bicep2's competitors have also been in hot pursuit of the microwave swirls. Within a year's time, maybe less, some of these groups may report their findings.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/103/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30What's certain is that current and future missions will provide ever more refined data that will sharpen the inflationary approach. Bear in mind that inflation is a paradigm, not a unique theory. Theorists have now implemented the core idea of the bang-as-repulsive-gravity in hundreds of ways (different numbers of inflaton fields, different interactions between those fields and so on), with each generally yielding slightly different predictions. The Bicep2 data has already winnowed the viable models significantly, and forthcoming data will continue the process.

But there's an even larger lesson. Barring the unlikely possibility that with better measurements the swirls disappear, we now have a new observational window onto quantum processes in the early universe. The Bicep2 data shows that these processes happen on distance scales more than a trillion times smaller than those probed by our most powerful particle accelerator, the Large Hadron Collider. Some years ago, together with a group of researchers, I took one of the first forays into calculating how our cutting-edge theories of the ultra-small, like string theory, might be tested with observations of the microwave background radiation. Now, with this unprecedented leap into the microrealm, I can imagine that more refined studies of this sort may well herald the next phase in our understanding of gravity, quantum mechanics and our cosmic origins.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/103/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30Finally, let me address an issue I've so far carefully avoided, one that's as wondrous as it is speculative. A possible byproduct of the inflationary theory is that our universe may not be the only universe.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/103/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30In many inflationary models, the inflaton field is so efficient that even after fueling the repulsive push of our Big Bang, the field stands ready to fuel another big bang and another still. Each bang yields its own expanding realm, with our universe being relegated to one among many. In fact, in these models, the inflationary process typically proves never-ending, it's eternal, and so yields an unlimited number of universes populating a grand cosmic multiverse.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/103/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30With evidence for the inflationary paradigm accumulating, it's tempting to conclude that confidence in the multiverse should grow too. While I'm sympathetic to that perspective, the situation is far from clear-cut. Quantum fluctuations not only yield variations within a given universe-a prime example being the microwave background variations we've discussed-they also entail variations between the universes themselves. And these variations can be significant. In some incarnations of the theory, the other universes might differ even in the kinds of particles they contain and the forces that are at work.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/103/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30In this enormously broadened perspective on reality, the challenge is to articulate what the inflationary theory actually predicts. How do we explain what we see here, in this universe? Do we have to reason that our form of life couldn't exist in the different environments of most other universes, and that's why we find ourselves here-a controversial approach that strikes some scientists as a cop-out? The concern, then, is that with the eternal version of inflation spawning so many universes, each with distinct features, the theory has the capacity to undermine our very reason for having confidence in inflation itself.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/103/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30Physicists continue to struggle with these lacunae. Many have confidence that these are mere technical challenges to inflation that in time will be solved. I tend to agree. Inflation's explanatory package is so remarkable, and its most natural predictions so spectacularly aligned with observation, that it all seems almost too beautiful to be wrong. But until the subtleties raised by the multiverse are resolved, it is wise to reserve final judgment.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/103/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30If inflation is right, the visionaries who developed the theory and the pioneers who confirmed its predictions are well-deserving of the Nobel Prize. Yet, the story would be bigger still. Achievements of this magnitude transcend the individual. It would be a moment for all of us to stand proud and marvel that our collective creativity and insight had revealed some of the universe's most deeply held secrets.SIDEBARThe result knocked him back on his heels. The math showed that the fabric of space was either stretching or contracting, which meant the universe was either growing or shrinking.SIDEBARThe Big Bang is often described as the modern scientific theory of creation, the mathematical answer to Genesis. But this obscures a fallacy. It does not tell us how the universe began.SIDEBARIs there a process that would have imprinted a tiny message in the early universe? Quantum physics answers with a resounding yes. It comes down to the uncertainty principle.SIDEBARIn fact, in these models the inflationary process typically proves never-ending, and so yields an unlimited number of universes populating a grand cosmic multiverse.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/105/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30On a scorching June day in 1884, a throng of people dressed in bathing suits and swimming caps crammed together on New York's Coney Island beach. They were about to witness the unveiling of a new invention: the roller coaster. Built by a then-unknown carpenter named LaMarcus Thompson, the Switchback Railway cost a nickel to ride, it was a steep price at the time, but to Thompson and, he hoped, many passengers, it would be worth every penny.

Passengers faced sideways, seated in connected benchlike cars. With the pull of a crank, the cars rolled down the hilly 600-foot track and up the other side at a speed of 6 mph. When they reached the other end, riders disembarked so the cars could be moved to a second track for the return trip.

One onlooker recalled feeling "nauseous but excited" just from watching the test run. Like many New Yorkers, he enjoyed going to P.T. Barnum's newly created circus and visiting the recently opened Central Park Zoo. But he'd never experienced anything quite so exhilarating as a roller coaster before.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/105/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30This is just what Thompson had in mind when he built his Switchback Railway. He had done research on the 80-foot-tall ice-covered slides enjoyed by Russians in the 1600s. The 9-mile-long Mauch Chunk Switchback Railway in Pennsylvania also served as a model. But mostly, Thompson used his intuition and his passion for inventing to inspire him.

But in the first three weeks of its opening, the Switchback paid for its $1,600 construction cost. And Thompson became known as "the Father of Gravity." Within four years, he built 50 more roller coasters around the country.

Competitors fought to erect coasters that were faster and more daring than ever before. By the 1920s, there were more than 2,000 worldwide. And that was just the beginning.

They hoped to be among the first to conquer X2, a redesign of X, the park's most popular roller coaster. X2 cost $10 million to build and six months to complete. But with seats that rotate 360-degrees and tunnels with noises, fog, and flashing lights, park officials were hoping the new ride would be worth it. So did the crowd.

These days, it's not enough to be whisked up and down on a rickety wooden track. In fact, the more corkscrew turns, inversion loops, and petrifying 50-story drops, the better,

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/105/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30There are more than 300 amusement parks across the United States, from Busch Gardens Europe in Virginia to Disneyland in California. A growing number of them feature state-of-the-art roller coasters, like the X2. The Kingda Ka gigacoaster at Six Flags in Jackson, New Jersey, breaks records for speed and height, zooming from 0 to 135 mph in 3.5 seconds while rocketing 456 feet into the air. Fahrenheit at Hersheypark in Hershey, Pennsylvania, boasts a 97-degree drop from 121 feet-the steepest of any in the United States.

Japan is home to four of the top 10 longest coasters in the world. Australia's Tower of Terror contains the second-tallest drop at 400 feet. And opening in 2009, Germany's Ring Racer will set a new record for speed: from 0 to 135 mph in just 2.5 seconds.

Despite increased safety precautions, approximately 1,800 ride-related injuries occur annually. But that doesn't stop the nearly 1.8 billion people worldwide from descending on theme parks each year. Since its opening, Magic Mountain's X2 has attracted 1,600 riders per hour. As for those too timid to go on it... they can always take the safer route-stay home.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30Williams and Greenhaw reveal the depth of involvement of ordinary black folks in the Montgomery bus boycott and their brave resistance to Jim Crow, far beyond that which is commonly known. He recalls the many extraordinary blacks and whites of the South who rose above the required expectations and limitations of social conventions and played crucial roles in the formation of the modern civil rights movement. Although popular culture highlights the role of Martin Luther King Jr. and Rosa Parks, Williams (who inherited the bus made famous by Parks and later donated it to the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan) and Greenhaw expose the reader to lesser-known figures: the Pullman porter and organizer E. D. Nixon, who provided the organization surrounding Parks' resistance; Fred D. Gray, a minister and lawyer who played critical roles in the boycott; and Virginia and Clifford Durr, a white couple who provided discreet support. This book brings to life the boycott that catapulted the nation into the civil rights era, portraying the personal sacrifices and heroism of ordinary people. -Vernon Ford

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30Williams and Greenhaw reveal the depth of involvement of ordinary black folks in the Montgomery bus boycott and their brave resistance to Jim Crow, far beyond that which is commonly known. He recalls the many extraordinary blacks and whites of the South who rose above the required expectations and limitations of social conventions and played crucial roles in the formation of the modern civil rights movement. Although popular culture highlights the role of Martin Luther King Jr. and Rosa Parks, Williams (who inherited the bus made famous by Parks and later donated it to the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan) and Greenhaw expose the reader to lesser-known figures: the Pullman porter and organizer E. D. Nixon, who provided the organization surrounding Parks' resistance; Fred D. Gray, a minister and lawyer who played critical roles in the boycott; and Virginia and Clifford Durr, a white couple who provided discreet support. This book brings to life the boycott that catapulted the nation into the civil rights era, portraying the personal sacrifices and heroism of ordinary people. -Vernon Ford

This is the day that seamstress Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat in the front of a Montgomery, Alabama, bus to a white man. The story is well known. Mrs. Parks was arrested. Four days later blacks in Montgomery mounted a boycott of city buses which lasted 381 days and resulted in the full integration of public transportation in the city.

The main problem in sustaining the bus boycott was the fact that blacks in the city had to find a way to get to and from work. A massive carpool was organized by members of the city's black churches. Graetz's assignment was to drive black people to work between the hours of 6 A.M. and 9 A.M.

He declared, "The Negroes are laughing at white people behind their backs. They think it's very funny and amusing that whites who are opposed to the boycott will act as chauffeurs to Negroes who are boycotting the buses. When a white person gives a Negro a single penny for transportation or helps a Negro with his transportation, he is helping the Negro radicals who run the boycott. The Negroes have made their own bed and whites should let them sleep in it."

Its members made harassing telephone calls to white households that provided transportation for Negro maids and cooks. Fliers were circulated throughout the city identifying white people who were helping blacks get to work. The fliers read: "Listed below are a few of the white people who are still hauling their Negro maids. This must be stopped. These people would appreciate a call from you, day or night. Let them know how we feel about them hauling Negroes."

The Miracle of the Montgomery Bus Boycott. By Robert J. Walker. Lanham, Md.: Hamilton Books, 2007. x, 358 pp. $47.00. ISBN 978-0-7618-3706-0.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30An educator at Alabama State University, Robert J. Walker views his book as a corrective to the "often overlooked fact that God was the true initiator of the Montgomery Bus Boycott and the Civil Rights Movement" (p. 6). While historians have long recognized religion's inspirational role in the movement, for Walker the movement was "an act of divine intervention" (p. 6) and African Americans were God's chosen people for redeeming the nation. Walker regards slavery, segregation, and racism as evils inspired by Satan and challenges to them evidence of God's intervention in history. While offering a detailed narrative account of the boycott, Walker claims "this book is more inspirational than anything else. When you finish reading, you will be inspired to activism" (p. 6). Clearly, then, this is not, and is not intended to be, a conventional history, with the historian's focus on long and short-term causative factors, and the role of chance and accident. God is referred to on almost every page. Most chapters begin with an extensive biblical quotation and end with conversational invitations to relax, take a break, enjoy the story, or, when appropriate, reflect on Walker's often vivid descriptions of the damage wrought by segregation and racism.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30Walker is a former fifth-grade teacher in the Jackson, Mississippi, public school system, and he writes in a style intended to enable ready understanding by fifth graders and above. An African American from Columbus, Mississippi, who grew up in the segregated South, Walker finds "it interesting that most of the books written today on the Civil Rights Movement are written by white historians" (p. 28) . He warns that "100 years from now white historians may attempt to rewrite the history of the Montgomery Bus Boycott" and cast Rosa Parks, whose arrest for refusing to give up a seat to a white person sparked the boycott, "as a sympathetic middle-aged white woman who decided to sit in the colored section to point out the injustice of the Montgomery Bus Segregation laws" (p. 28).

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30Walker relies heavily on nonarchival primary materials, including memoirs, contemporary and retrospective newspaper stories, and a few interviews by himself and others. The result is narrative- driven history, rich in detail but lacking analytical thrust and new insights. The bibliography omits key secondary works, such as J. Mills Thornton's "Challenge and Response in the Montgomery Bus Boycott of 1955-1956" (Alabama Review 33, July 1980), David J. Garrow's Bearing the Cross (New York, 1986), Adam Fair dough's To Redeem the Soul of America (Athens, Ga., 1987), and Taylor Branch's Parting the Waters (New York, 1988).

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30Nevertheless, Walker recognizes the complexity and diversity of Montgomery's African American and white communities. He gives due weight to the crucial role of black women in the boycott, discusses the contribution of sympathetic whites, and notes conflict among organizers and opponents. Although he attributes the protesters' victory to God, Walker does not neglect the participation of NAACP lawyer Fred Gray, who filed the federal suit Brow der v. Gay Ie that overturned the city's segregated transportation laws and ensured the boycott's success. Walker's description of post-boycott white violence against some leading protesters and vindictive reprisals by state authorities is instructive about the persistence of white opposition.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30Walker ends the book with tributes to Rosa Parks and C oretta Scott King, an indictment of enduring white racism in present-day America, and a plea for African Americans to address problems within the community - among them, crime, AIDS, high rates of teenage pregnancy, school dropouts, and a preoccupation with instant gratification and conspicuous consumption. Walker's message, apart from a desire to pay tribute to God, is that the boycott, and the ability of blacks not only to survive slavery and segregation but to contribute to human achievement and civilization, should inspire African Americans with the belief and desire to tackle current challenges to the community.

But now scenes better suited for the absurd stories of Kafka snake their way into serious courtroom encounters. While no federal court has yet heard a case on behalf of sulking baseball fans, last year the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York responded to a complaint filed against McDonald's by a class of obese customers, alleging among other things that the company acted negligently in selling foods that were high in cholesterol, fat, salt, and sugar. In the past 10 years we have seen an outburst of class action lawsuits that alleged harm to buyers. With classes numbering in the thousands, these suits may bring great riches to tort lawyers, even if they provide little relief to the plaintiffs. The sheer size of the claims and the number of claimants often intimidate defending firms, which fear that their reputations will be tarnished in the media and their stock prices will be punished - not because of the merits but from the ensuing publicity. In his opinion in the McDonald's case, judge Robert W. Sweet suggested that the McDonald's suit could "spawn thousands of similar 'McLawsuits' against restaurants." Recent books with titles like Fat Land and Fast Food Nation promote the view that fast food firms are harming our health and turning us into a people who are forced to shop in the "big and tall" section of the clothing stores.

More cars, more suburbs, and more roads have made roadside eating more convenient. During the 19508, drive-through and drive-in hamburger, ice cream, and pizza joints catered to a mobile population. McDonald's, which specialized in roadside restaurants, eclipsed White Castle hamburger stands in the 19608 because the latter had focused more on urban walk-up customers. The McDonald's road signs in the early 19605 boasted of serving ? million hamburgers; now McDonalds claims to have sold over 99 billion. The "zeros" in ioo billion will not fit on the firm's tote-board signs when the one-hundred-billionth burger is sold.

"They hypnotize the kids." "They bribe the kids with toys." "They destroy our taste for more sophisticated foods." These condemnations often come from highbrow observers who claim that fast food customers are too ignorant or too blinded to understand what they are putting in their own mouths. The onslaught of criticism is not limited to the food. Animal rights activists condemn fast food outlets for animal cruelty. Environmentalists allege that fast food produces too much "McLitter." Orthodox organic food fans accuse fast food firms of using genetically modified ingredients, which they call "frankenfoods." In Europe, anti-globalization protestors allege that fast food homogenizes culture and spreads capitalism far and wide.

Tort lawyers around the country settled the $2.46 billion tobacco case in 1998. Those who have not retired on their stake from that settlement are wondering whether fast food could be the "next tobacco," along with HMOS and lead paint. After all, the surgeon general estimates that obesity creates about $115 billion in annual health care costs. There are differences, of course. No one, so far, has shown that cheeseburgers are chemically addictive. Furthermore, most fast food restaurants freely distribute their nutritional content and offer a variety of meals, some high in fat, some not. Nor is it clear that the average fast food meal is significantly less nutritious than the average restaurant meal, or even the average home meal. The iconic 1943 Norman Rockwell Thanksgiving painting ("Freedom from Want") highlights a plump turkey, which is high in protein. But surely the proud hostess has also prepared gravy, stuffing, and a rich pie for dessert - which, though undoubtedly tasty, would not win a round of applause from nutritionists.

Before jumping into today's fashionable condemnation of calories, let us spend a moment on historical perspective and at least admit that for mankind's first couple hundred thousand years of existence, the basic human problem was how to get enough calories and micronutrients. Forget the caveman era: As recently as 100 years ago, most people were not receiving adequate nutrition. Malnutrition was rampant, stunting growth, hindering central nervous systems, and making people more susceptible to disease. Often, poor people begged on the streets because they did not have the sheer physical energy to work at a job, even if work was available to them. By modern standards even affluent people a century ago were too small, too thin, and too feeble, as economist Robert W. Fogel has noted. A century ago, an American with some spare time and spare change was more likely to sign up for a weight-gaining class than a weight-loss program.

The two are related, of course. For most of human history only the wealthy were plump; paintings of patrons by Peter Paul Rubens illustrated that relationship. In ancient times figurines of Venus (carved thousands of years ago) displayed chunky thighs, big bellies, and BMIS far above today's obesity levels. Likewise, skinny people looked suspicious to the ancients. (Remember that the backstabbing Cassius had a "lean and hungry look.") The rise in the BMI from the nineteenth century to about 1960 should be counted as one of the great social and medical victories of modern times. In a sense, it created a more equal social status, as well as a more equal physical stature.

In fact, the BMI has been rising fairly steadily for the past 120 years. Nonetheless, since the 19605 the higher BMI scores have surpassed the optimal zone of about z o to 25.2 No doubt, a more sedentary lifestyle adds to this concern. (In contrast, the healthy rise in BMIS during the early 19005 might be attributed to gaining more muscle, which weighs more than fat.). The post-i96os rise in BMI scores is similar to a tree that grows 12 inches per year but in its tenth year starts casting an unwanted shadow on your patio. In the case of people, more mass from fat has diminishing returns, cutting down their life spans and raising the risk for diabetes, heart disease, gallbladder disease, and even cancer. Over half of American adults are overweight, and nearly a quarter actually qualify as obese, according to the National Institutes of Health.

According to the caricature described by lawyers suing fast food companies, poor, ill-educated people are duped by duplicitous restaurant franchises into biting into greasy hamburgers and french fries. The data, however, tell us that this theory is wrong. If the "blame fast food" hypothesis were correct, we would see a faster pace of BMI growth among poorly educated people, who might not be able to read or understand nutritional labels. In fact, college-educated people - not the poorly educated - accounted for the most rapid growth in BMI scores between the 19708 and the 19905. (Poorly educated people still have a higher overall incidence of obesity.) The percentage of obese college-educated women nearly tripled between the early 19705 and the early 19905. In comparison, the proportion of obese women without high school degrees rose by only 5 8 percent. Among men, the results were similar. Obesity among those without high school degrees climbed by about 5 3 percent, but obesity among college graduates jumped by 163 percent.3 If the "blame fast food" hypothesis made sense, these data would be flipped upside down.

On average, Americans are eating about zoo calories more each day than they did in the 1970s. An additional zoo calories can be guzzled in a glass of milk or a soda or gobbled in a bowl of cereal, for example. Fast food's critics eagerly pounce and allege that the additional calories come from super-sized meals of pizza, burgers, or burritos. It is true that between the 19705 and 19905, daily fast food intake grew from an average of 60 calories to 200 calories. But simply quoting these data misleads. Though Americans have been consuming somewhat more fast food at mealtime, they have reduced their home consumption at mealtime. Americans have cut back their home meals by about zz8 calories for men and 177 for women, offsetting the rise in fast food calories.4 In total, mealtime calories have not budged much, and mealtimes are when consumers generally visit fast food restaurants.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30So where are the 200 additional calories coming from? The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has compiled the "Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals," which collects information on where a food was purchased, how it was prepared, and where it was eaten, in addition to demographic information such as race, income, age, and sex. The survey shows that the answer is as close as the nearest salty treat. Americans are not eating bigger breakfasts, lunches, or dinners - but they are noshing and nibbling like never before. Between the 1970s and the 19905, men and women essentially doubled the calories consumed between meals (by between 160 and 240 calories). In 1987-88, Americans typically snacked less than once a day; by 1994 they were snacking 1.6 times per day. But surely, opponents of fast food would argue, those cookies and pre-wrapped apple pies at McDonald's must account for calories. Again the data fail to make their case. Women ate only about six more snack calories at fast food restaurants, while men ate eight more snack calories, over the past two decades. That is roughly equal to one Cheez-It cracker or a few raisins. Where do Americans eat their between-meal calories? Mostly at home. Kitchen cabinets can be deadly to diets. And in a fairly recent development, supermarket shoppers are pulling goodies off of store shelves and ripping into them at the stores before they even drive home. Consumers eat two to three times more goodies inside stores than at fast food restaurants.

From an historical point of view that is a very good thing. A smaller portion of today's family budget goes to food than at any time during the twentieth century. In 1929, families spent 23.5 percent of their incomes on food. In 1961, they spent 17 percent. By 2001, American families could spend just 10 percent of their incomes on food, according to the u s DA'S Economic Research Service. The lower relative cost of food made it easier, of course, for people to consume more.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30Since the mid-1980s we have seen an interesting change in restaurant pricing, which has made restaurants more attractive to consumers. Compared to supermarket prices, restaurant prices have actually fallen since 1986. Whereas a restaurant meal was 1.82, times the cost of a store-bought meal in 1986, by 2001 a restaurant meal cost just 1.73 times as much. Higher incomes and lower relative restaurant prices have induced people to eat more, and to eat more away from home.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/110/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30The nature of the American workplace may also be contributing to higher caloric intake. Whether people dine while sitting down at a table or while standing at a fast food counter, at the workplace they are literally sitting down on the job more than they have during prior eras. More sedentary desk jobs probably contribute to wider bottoms. Consider two middleincome jobs, one in 1953 and one in 2003. In 1953,3 dockworker lifts 50 boxes off of a mini-crane and places them on a handtruck, which he pulls to a warehouse. In 2,003, a person earning a similar income would be sitting in front of a computer, inputting data and matching orders with deliveries. What's the key difference? Until recently, employers paid employees to exert energy and burn calories. In contrast, employers now pay workers to stay in their seats. For many, the most vigorous exercise comes from tearing off a sheet of paper from a printer or walking to the refrigerator. Furthermore, the decline in factory work - with its fixed lunch and coffee break schedule enables people to eat more often. Less factory work means less supervision by foremen. According to Bureau of Labor Statistics data, manufacturing employment fell from about 24.4 percent of civilian employment in 1970 to merely 13 percent in 2000. A woman who spends her career sitting at a desk may "end up with as much as 3.3 units of BMI more than someone with a highly active job," explain economists Darius Lakdawalla and Tomas Philipson. And a person telecommuting from home may be sitting even closer to the refrigerator or cupboard. In 1970 the term "telecommuting" did not even exist. By 2000, however, with advances in computers and remote access technology, approximately 12 percent of the workforce worked from home at least part of the week. This figure does not include over 2 5 million home-based businesses in the United States. Casual observation implies that many telecommuters take breaks from their home work at coffee shops and other sellers of baked goods.

But it is a mistake to stereotype fast food as simply a cheeseburger and a large fries. Fast food restaurants have vastly expanded their menus for a variety of reasons including health concerns and demographic shifts. The increasing role of Hispanic Americans in determining national food tastes has inspired many fast food franchises to offer tacos, burritos, and salsa salads. Wendy's, traditionally known for its squareshaped hamburgers, offers a low-fat chili dish that the Minnesota attorney general's office recommended as a "healthier choice" in its fast food guide. McDonald's has continuously revamped its menu in recent years. On March 20, 2003, the company unveiled a new line of "premium salads" that feature Newman's Own All-Natural Dressings. In its publicity blitz, McDonald's facetiously asked, "What's Next? Wine Tasting?" Meanwhile Burger King features broiled chicken teriyaki in addition to its traditional fare. judge Sweet noted that the Subway sandwich chain, which boasts of healthy choices, hired a spokesman who apparently lost 230 pounds of weight while eating the "Subway Diet." In fact, fast food meals today derive fewer calories from fat than they did in the 19705. Consumers can customize their fast food meals, too. Simply by asking for "no mayo," they may cut down fat calories by an enormous proportion. It is worth pointing out that fast food firms introduced these alternative meals in response to changing consumer tastes, not in reply to dubious lawsuits. During the 19905, McDonald's and Taco Bell invested millions of dollars trying to develop lowfat, commercially viable selections such as the McLean Deluxe hamburger and Taco Bell's Border Lights. Burger King adopted its "Have It Your Way" slogan several decades ago.

Home cooking, of course, has a nice ring to it, and it is hard to criticize the idea of a traditional meal cooked by mom or dad. But if we put nostalgia aside for a moment, we can see that the typical American meal of 2 5 years ago might win taste contests but few prizes from today's nutritionists. Meat loaf, fried chicken, butter-whipped potatoes, and a tall glass of whole milk may have kept us warm on a cold winter evening, but such a diet would surely fail a modern test for healthy living. And let's not even discuss a crusty apple pie or bread pudding for dessert. Yesterday's comfort food gives today's dietitians indigestion. It is no surprise, then, that today's fast food derives a smaller percentage of calories from fat than a typical home meal from 1977-78. In fact, even in the 19705, fast food meals had almost the same fat/calorie ratio as home cooking at that time. By this measure of fat/calories, fast food in the 19705 looked healthier than restaurant cooking, according to USDA figures. Therefore, the caricature of fast food restaurants as a devilish place for nutrition makes little historical sense.

Very few families these days feast on pork rinds and pecan pie, a development that flatters our current nutritional tables. How do fast food meals compare to schools? Despite the legions of concerned dietitians and PTA leaders, school meals do not look considerably better on the test of fat. While schools provide slightly fewer fat calories than fast food, they deliver more saturated fat, the more dangerous subset of fats. The comparison to sitdown restaurants is similar, with no clear advantage to either fast food or sit-down restaurants. In fact, the Chou study cited above finds that a proliferation of full-service restaurants would raise obesity levels more than a proliferation of fast food establishments. Of course, fast food firms have made it easier for patrons to learn about nutritional content than fancier kinds of food outlets. Few patrons of the fabled 21 Club in New York would know that its $26 hamburger is made with rendered duck fat. Should superchef Daniel Boulud worry about lawsuits for daring to sell a $29 hamburger at DB Bistro Moderne that is Grafted from ground sirloin and braised short ribs, stuffed with foie gras, and topped with shaved black truffles?

True, fast-food restaurants have been offering super-sized sandwiches, drinks, and french fries. But have these critics been to a movie theater lately, where popcorn containers look like bushel baskets? Or to fancy restaurants featuring allyou-can-eat Sunday buffets? A study in the Journal of the American Medical Association (January 22, 2003) cited the "most surprising result [as] the large portion-size increases for food consumed at home - a shift that indicates marked changes in eating behavior in general." People eat bigger portions of hamburgers, fries, and Mexican food on their own kitchen tables than when they are sitting on a fast food restaurant stool. In the study, "Patterns and Trends in Food Portion Sizes, 1977-1988," researchers Samara J. Nielsen and Barry M. Popkin found that "the average homecooked hamburger now weighs in at about 8 ounces, versus perhaps 5.5 ounces in full-service restaurants and a little over 7 ounces at fast-food outlets." When the USDA surveyed portion sizes and compared them to official U.S. government portions, they did find that fast food hamburgers exceeded official estimates by 11 z percent. Yet they also found that Americans were eating pasta portions that surpass official measures by 3 3 3 percent and muffins that rise to 480 percent of the official sizes.6 If we are turning into a jumbo people, we are a jumbo people everywhere we eat, not just where the tort lawyers target defendants.

Yet because critics accuse fast food of selling "empty" calories (that is, calories comprised of fats and sugars), I have developed a more specific benchmark, namely, cost per gram of protein. Protein is the building block for muscles, and animal protein foods including meat, poultry, fish, dairy products, and eggs contain the nine essential amino acids that cannot be synthesized in the body. Using the ratio of dollar/protein gram seems reasonable and, because it does not include fats and sugars, creates a tougher test for fast food than the dollar/calorie measure.

In a survey of fast food chains and supermarkets in five southern California communities (where the fast food chains and the supermarkets were located within the same towns), I compared the cost of purchasing a "marquee" hamburger, a grilled chicken sandwich, a fish sandwich, a sliced turkey sandwich, and a green salad. The results suggest that in some cases consumers can actually purchase a high protein meal at a fast food chain for less than the cost of buying the separate groceries at a supermarket and preparing the sandwich themselves. The comparisons also understate the cost of supermarket purchases, for two principal reasons: First, supermarket prices generally reflect a cost savings for purchasing a larger quantity. You can order one fish fillet from Burger King, but it is nearly impossible to buy a single frozen fish fillet in your supermarket. second, supermarket prices do not reflect the time and cost to the shopper of preparing the meal at home. Nor have I included the extra ingredients such as pickles, relish, onion, mustard, and so on. There is little doubt that for a worker earning the average hourly rate (which is $15, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics), preparing a cooked sandwich would cost far more in materials and time than simply purchasing it from a fast food restaurant. Even for a minimum wage worker earning $5.15 per hour, a fast food sandwich is probably much cheaper than spending 30 minutes preparing and grilling a hamburger, fish fillet, or chicken breast.

Each sandwich provides z 5 grams of protein. During a recent national campaign, both of these restaurant chains slashed their prices, bringing the dollar/protein ratio down to just 3.8 cents. The supermarket survey shows that a gram of protein from a ground beef patty and bun costs about 8 cents (leaner beef would cost somewhat more, standard ground beef somewhat less). Again, the cost of supermarket beef does not include the cost of accompaniments such as lettuce and tomato, nor does it include any time or labor costs for preparing a sandwich yourself.

A Burger King grilled chicken sandwich provides 3 5 grams of protein at 10.5 cents per gram. McDonald's grilled chicken costs 13.9 cents per gram. Purchasing chicken breast fillets at a supermarket averages just 4.6 cents per gram of protein. Again, the comparison does not include the extra costs or time involved in creating a grilled chicken sandwich served with lettuce, tomato, and seasoning.

While a Subway turkey sandwich costs almost 24 cents per gram of protein, sliced Sara Lee turkey averages just over 10 cents per gram of protein. Once again, the Subway sandwich also includes lettuce, tomatoes, green peppers, onion, olives, pickles, and a choice of breads, as well as the convenience of someone else putting together the meal.

Because greens are not notable for their protein content, I have instead calculated the cost per ounce. A Burger King side salad costs just under 20 cents per ounce, compared with over 27 cents for a Fresh Express bag of prewashed "American Salad."

For people who lack the time, kitchen space, or ability to purchase from grocery stores and cook at home, fast food can provide significant benefits. Furthermore, if consumers choose with some level of prudence from the fast food menus, they can eat fairly nutritious meals.

In the 19808 and early 19903, "carbloading" was hot, and steaming bowls of pasta shoved roast beef off the dinner table. Today, a plate of pasta scares those on the popular, low-carb Atkins diet, who are instructed to load up their breakfast plates with fried eggs, ham, and bacon while leaving toast off to the side. According to the Atkins approach, it is fine to bite into a greasy hamburger, but don't dare chew on the bun. Desserts, too, have changed. During the 19605 and 19705, parents maneuvered to keep chocolate away from children, fearing the high fat and sugar content, as well as a connection to acne. More recently we read that cocoa powder and dark chocolate may help delay the progression of cardiovascular disease.7 Chocolate contains a healthful nutrient known as a flavonoid that may slow the oxidation of "bad cholesterol" (LDL). So maybe we should not worry so much about a few pimples.

Why not force fast food firms to serve meals that fit into the pyramid's architecture? The pyramid tells us to eat at least six servings of grain (breads, pasta, etc.) each day, two servings of fruit, and only a little bit of fat or sweets. Sounds reasonable, no? Here is what the controversial head of the Harvard School of Public Health says about the pyramid: "Some people are likely to die from following the USDA pyramid because they will be eliminating healthy fats, such as liquid vegetable oils, that actually reduce the risk of heart disease." Who should Wendy's listen to? The U.S. government or Harvard? Is this a fair choice for a restaurant?

Then, after McDonald's switched, many of the same advocates assailed McDonald's for using trans-fatty acids - a result of using the vegetable oils! Now McDonald's is introducing new vegetable oils that reduce the trans-fatty acids.

Fast food meals, though tasty to many patrons, are not chemically addictive. One seldom hears of Subway or Wendy's customers shaking with withdrawal symptoms when they give up a turkey sandwich or a fro/en fish fillet. Moreover, no one has yet claimed that he became sick or cancerous, or even choked or coughed, from "second-hand" eating. Swallowing food is very much an individual act.

In contrast, diet advice and research has been inconsistent and often contradictory. As a result, fast food firms have been reacting to the changing tastes and nutritional expectations of customers. As stated above, in the 19705 there was very little difference between the fat content of home-cooked meals and that of fast food meals. Fast food chains did not start out by conspiring to sell diabolical menus. Over the past 20 years, homes and fast food restaurants have pursued lower-fat menus (though homes have admittedly moved more quickly). This is to be expected since commercial restaurants would tend to follow the tastes of patrons. Today, nearly every fast food restaurant offers non-fried poultry and low-fat salads. Furthermore, within 2.0 seconds of inquiring, each of the fast food chains mentioned in this paper produced nutritional content charts. Should we expect or demand that fast food restaurants lead the march to better menus? How could they? What would they base it on? The federal government's nutrition pyramid? The Harvard pyramid? The Atkins diet? Weight Watchers? Oprah's personal plan? Clearly the best avenue is for fast food firms to provide choices and provide information so that customers can be informed, prudent, and as up-to-date as they like.

Salads had leapt to more than 10 percent of Wendy's total sales, from 3 percent a year earlier. In October zooz, Bloomberg News announced that "Wendy's 3rd-Qtr Net Rises 16 % as Salads Boost Sales." The story explained how Wendy's new "Garden Sensations" salad strategy was drawing customers from sit-down restaurants, while also posing new challenges to McDonald's and Burger King, "as consumers seek healthier choices." The story then described how Wendy's more healthful strategy spurred on "rival Burger King [which] is trying to gain market share by introducing new items that compete directly with Wendy's, including a baked potato and chili." Is this a broken system that desperately cries for judicial action? No, it is a super-competitive market where stores jockey for position, trying to please customers and their changing tastes for a more healthful lunch.

The Restatement (Second) of Torts explained that "Ordinary sugar is a deadly poison to some diabetics" and that "Good whiskey is not unreasonably dangerous merely because it will make some people drunk, and is especially dangerous to alcoholics; but bad whiskey, containing a dangerous amount of fuel oil, is unreasonably dangerous." These risks are not good reasons to outlaw good sugar or good whiskey. Fried fish may be oily, but that does not mean it is contaminated. Absent a truly compelling and sweeping health reason, we should not let lawsuits rob consumers of choices.

Thus any liability based on over-consumption is doomed if the consequences of such over-consumption are common knowledge. . . . Thus, in order to state a claim, the Complaint must allege either that the attributes of McDonald's products are so extraordinarily unhealthy that they are outside the reasonable contemplation of the consuming public or that the products are so extraordinarily unhealthy as to be dangerous in their intended use. The Complaint - which merely alleges that the foods contain high levels of cholesterol, fat, salt and sugar, and that the foods are therefore unhealthy - fails to reach this bar." judge Sweet also found, as I did in my survey, that McDonald's willingly provides information on the nutritional content of its products.

Should judge Sweet have stopped McDonald's from flipping burgers? What about diners at the 21 Club? Should they too be protected, or are the fast food lawsuits a patronizing tool to protect the poor and allegedly ill-educated from their own mouths? If the fear is overconsumption, should McDonald's discriminate against plump people? Should a cheeseburger require a doctor's prescription? Should fast food firms be required to punch holes in a meal ticket and refuse to serve those who have already filled their card? Surely some intermeddlers could devise a national BMI card, certified by a government nutritionist, that determines how many fat grams Burger King may sell to you. Of course, that number would have to be revised with each new issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association and after every meeting of the American Society for Clinical Nutrition.

A class action lawsuit would not be digging for scientific inferences. Instead, plaintiffs' lawyers would be digging into the pockets of franchise owners, employees, and shareholders in order to pull out gold. Moreover, the threat of such lawsuits can do no good to the employees, shareholders, or customers of fast food firms. When tort lawyers strut in front of cameras waving weighty complaints that are flimsy in facts, the media quickly follow the story. Nearly every major publication in the country carried stories about the McDonald's obesity suit. If "McLawsuits" spread, we will see at least one, if not all, of the following three results: 1) lower wages for fast food employees; 2) lower stock prices for shareholders; 3) higher prices for consumers. Fast food restaurants hire and train hundreds of thousands of workers, attract investments from millions of middle-class citizens, and quench the hunger and thirst of tens of millions of satisfied patrons.

You do not need a lawyer by your side to pry open a brochure or to check the thousands of websites that will provide nutrition data. While it is unlikely that nutritionists will soon announce that super-sized double cheeseburgers will make you thin, society should not allow the latest fads or the most lucrative lawsuits to govern what we eat for lunch.

These numbers are not definitive for each individual, since a very muscular person, for example, may have a high BMI simply because muscle weighs more than fat. For example, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone might technically be obese if one looked only at their BMI ratings.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/111/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30 I actually want to see more of them so that I need to drive less. To me, driving is more of a hobby, like photography. And when it is a hobby, you want to enjoy the activity and hope that, other than personal happiness, the act of taking pictures and driving should not have any real purpose. That's why I much prefer going into town using the public transport. Problem is, the public transportation system in Malaysia is still poorly organised. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/111/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30 It's true that you can get a taxi quite easily, and the three light-rail systems which criss-cross the city serve as an efficient shuttle between the most important destinations in the capital. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/111/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30 Buses, however, are still lagging behind, and that should not be the case at all. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/111/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30 Buses are the cheapest form of transportation, and in many major cities in Japan and Europe, they are clean and easily available. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/111/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30 However, the problem is that the capitalist system cannot reconcile the public's requirement for them to be cheap, clean and efficient, with the operator's need for returns on their huge investment. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/111/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30 In most countries, train and bus companies lose money regularly and stay in business with Government support. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/111/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30 Now, subsidy has become a dirty word and everyone thinks that they make industries weak and uncompetitive. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/111/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30 The fact is, developed countries give more subsidies to their industries than we can ever imagine. They do it by giving them huge margins through their defence spending, pumping money into research through universities and institutions, and harassing less-developed countries to pay their workers higher wages. In some countries, they just give direct subsidies to farmers but under some fancy name. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/111/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30 If you notice, all the subsidies are handed out to industries; God forbid they should start extending huge amounts of money to actually help the masses. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/111/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30 Everywhere else, Governments are trying their best to reduce handouts, and public transportation is their favourite slashing ground. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/111/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30 In Malaysia, only the train and domestic air service were used to Government help, whereas the bus companies had to make do on their own. The proliferation of local and stage bus companies showed that they could be profitable, otherwise why would companies want to operate them? Then, in the mid-1990s, the Government decided that bus companies should start merging into bigger operators in order to provide better service. It made sense. If they were profitable small, they could be more profitable when big and monopolistic. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/111/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30 They formed Park May and Intrakota, a fleet of brand-new buses were pressed into service featuring user-friendly low floors and comfortable air-conditioning. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/111/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30 The new buses were expensive, but the fleet operators are only allowed to charge a little more than what was from the rickety wooden bus days. Obviously, the revenue shortfalls turned them into a bleeding duopoly and service levels promptly degenerated to a level that is sometimes worse than before. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/111/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30 It would not be fair to say that Intrakota is not trying. In fact, they have been doing their best to maintain the expensive and sensitive buses but to little effect as our road conditions, coupled with drivers who are not maintenance-minded, are not doing them any favours. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/111/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30 The buses now look very tired and there is no fresh investment to improve things. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/111/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30 Subsidising public transport is not about making it cheaper for people to move around; it is about increasing the frequency of services so as to lead to considerable time savings, especially for the general working public. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/111/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30 Imagine if you only ever have to wait two minutes on a main artery like Jalan Bangsar to get on a bus into the city centre. If the buses are clean, frequent and reliable, more people will surely be attracted to use public transportation. And that means the country can cut its fuel bill by some margin, not to mention save precious time for our human resources. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/111/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30 Obviously, there are people who cannot use public transportation for security or schedular reasons, but most of us should use them. It is true that mopeds and scooters can be cheaper, but they can be less than safe and not everyone should have to take the risk and be vulnerable on a bike. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/111/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30 But more importantly than anything else, an efficient public transportation is our best chance for reducing greenhouse gases and other environmental and health hazards associated with the internal combustion engine. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/111/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30 Since I much prefer trees and furry animals to Nintendo games and shiny computers, I think we should all try to use more public transportation and urge the Government to spend more on supporting them. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/111/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30 And since we are on the issue of conservation - if someone wants to see the jungle and not cut down its trees, then they should walk there and just leave their noisy and smoky mud-churning off-roaders by the roadside or in a designated car park area where they belong.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/115/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30Veterinarians should have an affinity for animals and the ability to get along with their owners.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/115/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30Graduation from an accredited college of veterinary medicine and a State license are required.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/115/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30About 1 out of 5 veterinarians was self-employed; self-employed veterinarians usually have to work hard and long to build a sufficient client base.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/115/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30Veterinarians play a major role in the healthcare of pets, livestock, and zoo, sporting, and laboratory animals. Some veterinarians use their skills to protect humans against diseases carried by animals and conduct clinical research on human and animal health problems. Others work in basic research, broadening the scope of fundamental theoretical knowledge, and in applied research, developing new ways to use knowledge.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/115/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30Most veterinarians perform clinical work in private practices. More than 50 percent of these veterinarians predominately, or exclusively treat small animals. Small-animal practitioners usually care for companion animals, such as dogs and cats, but also treat birds, reptiles, rabbits, and other animals that can be kept as pets. About one-fourth of all veterinarians work in mixed animal practices, where they see pigs, goats, sheep, and some nondomestic animals in addition to companion animals. Veterinarians in clinical practice diagnose animal health problems; vaccinate against diseases, such as distemper and rabies; medicate animals suffering from infections or illnesses; treat and dress wounds; set fractures; perform surgery; and advise owners about animal feeding, behavior, and breeding.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/115/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30A small number of private-practice veterinarians work exclusively with large animals, mostly horses or cows; some also care for various kinds of food animals. These veterinarians usually drive to farms or ranches to provide veterinary services for herds or individual animals. Much of this work involves preventive care to maintain the health of the animals. These veterinarians test for and vaccinate against diseases and consult with farm or ranch owners and managers regarding animal production, feeding, and housing issues. They also treat and dress wounds, set fractures, and perform surgery, including cesarean sections on birthing animals. Veterinarians euthanize animals when necessary. Other veterinarians care for zoo, aquarium, or laboratory animals.

Veterinarians working in research use a full range of sophisticated laboratory equipment.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/115/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30Veterinarians can contribute to human as well as animal health. A number of veterinarians work with physicians and scientists as they research ways to prevent and treat various human health problems. For example, veterinarians contributed greatly in conquering malaria and yellow fever, solved the mystery of botulism, produced an anticoagulant used to treat some people with heart disease, and defined and developed surgical techniques for humans, such as hip and knee joint replacements and limb and organ transplants. Today, some determine the effects of drug therapies, antibiotics, or new surgical techniques by testing them on animals.

Veterinarians who are livestock inspectors check animals for transmissible diseases, advise owners on the treatment of their animals and may quarantine animals. Veterinarians who are meat, poultry, or egg product inspectors examine slaughtering and processing plants, check live animals and carcasses for disease, and enforce government regulations regarding food purity and sanitation.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/115/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30Veterinarians often work long hours. Those in group practices may take turns being on call for evening, night, or weekend work; solo practitioners may work extended and weekend hours, responding to emergencies or squeezing in unexpected appointments. The work setting often can be noisy.

They work outdoors in all kinds of weather and may have to treat animals or perform surgery under unsanitary conditions. When working with animals that are frightened or in pain, veterinarians risk being bitten, kicked, or scratched.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/115/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30Prospective veterinarians must graduate with a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (D.V.M. or V.M.D.) degree from a 4-year program at an accredited college of veterinary medicine and must obtain a license to practice. There are 28 colleges in 26 States that meet accreditation standards set by the Council on Education of the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA). The prerequisites for admission vary. Many of these colleges do not require a bachelors degree for entrance, but all require a significant number of credit hours-ranging from 45 to 90 semester hours-at the undergraduate level. However, most of the students admitted have completed an undergraduate program. Applicants without a bachelors degree face a difficult task gaining admittance.

Veterinary medical colleges typically require classes in organic and inorganic chemistry, physics, biochemistry, general biology, animal biology, animal nutrition, genetics, vertebrate embryology, cellular biology, microbiology, zoology, and systemic physiology. Some programs require calculus; some require only statistics, college algebra and trigonometry, or precalculus. Most veterinary medical colleges also require core courses, including some in English or literature, the social sciences, and the humanities. Increasingly, courses in practice management and career development are becoming a standard part of the curriculum, to provide a foundation of general business knowledge for new graduates.

Formal experience, such as work with veterinarians or scientists in clinics, agribusiness, research, or some area of health science, is particularly advantageous. Less formal experience, such as working with animals on a farm or ranch or at a stable or animal shelter, also is helpful. Students must demonstrate ambition and an eagerness to work with animals.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/115/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30There is keen competition for admission to veterinary school. The number of accredited veterinary colleges has remained largely the same since 1983, whereas the number of applicants has risen significantly. Only about 1 in 3 applicants was accepted in 2004. AVMA-recognized veterinary specialties-such as pathology, internal medicine, dentistry, nutrition, ophthalmology, surgery, radiology, preventive medicine, and laboratory animal medicine-are usually in the form of a 2-year internship. Interns receive a small salary but usually find that their internship experience leads to a higher beginning salary, relative to those of other starting veterinarians. Veterinarians who seek board certification in a specialty also must complete a 3- to 4-year residency program that provides intensive training in specialties such as internal medicine, oncology, radiology, surgery, dermatology, anesthesiology, neurology, cardiology, ophthalmology, and exotic small-animal medicine.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/115/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30All States and the District of Columbia require that veterinarians be licensed before they can practice. The only exemptions are for veterinarians working for some Federal agencies and some State governments. Licensing is controlled by the States and is not strictly uniform, although all States require the successful completion of the D.V.M. degree-or equivalent education-and a passing grade on a national board examination. The Educational Commission for Foreign Veterinary Graduates (ECFVG) grants certification to individuals trained outside the United States who demonstrate that they meet specified requirements for the English language and for clinical proficiency. ECFVG certification fulfills the educational requirement for licensure in all States. Applicants for licensure satisfy the examination requirement by passing the North American Veterinary Licensing Exam (NAVLE),an 8-hour computer-based examination consisting of 360 multiple-choice questions covering all aspects of veterinary medicine. Administered by the National Board of Veterinary Medical Examiners (NBVME),the NAVLE includes visual materials designed to test diagnostic skills and constituting 10 percent of the total examination.

Some States do additional testing on clinical competency as well. There are few reciprocal agreements between States, making it difficult for a veterinarian to practice in a different State without first taking that States examination.

They should have an affinity for animals and the ability to get along with their owners, especially pet owners, who tend to form a strong bond with their pet. Veterinarians who intend to go into private practice should possess excellent communication and business skills, because they will need to manage their practice and employees successfully and promote, market, and sell their services.

About 1 out of 5 veterinarians was self-employed in a solo or group practice. Most others were salaried employees of another veterinary practice. The Federal Government employed about 1,200 civilian veterinarians, chiefly in the U.S. Departments of Agriculture, Health and Human Services, and, increasingly, Homeland Security. Other employers of veterinarians are State and local governments, colleges of veterinary medicine, medical schools, research laboratories, animal food companies, and pharmaceutical companies. A few veterinarians work for zoos, but most veterinarians caring for zoo animals are private practitioners who contract with the zoos to provide services, usually on a part-time basis.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/115/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-30Employment of veterinarians is expected to increase as fast as average for all occupations over the 200414 projection period. Despite this average growth, very good job opportunities are expected because the 28 schools of veterinary medicine, even at full capacity, result in a limited number of graduates each year. However, as mentioned earlier, there is keen competition for admission to veterinary school. As pets are increasingly viewed as a member of the family, pet owners will be more willing to spend on advanced veterinary medical care, creating further demand for veterinarians.

Recent trends indicate particularly strong interest in cats as pets. Faster growth of the cat population is expected to increase the demand for feline medicine and veterinary services, while demand for veterinary care for dogs should continue to grow at a more modest pace.

More pet owners even purchase pet insurance, increasing the likelihood that a considerable amount of money will be spent on veterinary care for their pets. More pet owners also will take advantage of nontraditional veterinary services, such as preventive dental care.

This situation will not necessarily limit the ability of veterinarians to find employment or to set up and maintain a practice in a particular area. Rather, beginning veterinarians may take positions requiring evening or weekend work to accommodate the extended hours of operation that many practices are offering. Some veterinarians take salaried positions in retail stores offering veterinary services. Self-employed veterinarians usually have to work hard and long to build a sufficient client base.

Nevertheless, job prospects may be better for veterinarians who specialize in farm animals than for companion-animal practitioners because of low earnings in the former specialty and because many veterinarians do not want to work in rural or isolated areas.

Homeland security also may provide opportunities for veterinarians involved in efforts to minimize animal diseases and prevent them from entering the country. Veterinarians with training in food safety, animal health and welfare, and public health and epidemiology should have the best opportunities for a career in the Federal Government.

Congressional reaction has largely been supportive of U.S. response efforts. However, the first case of a patient diagnosed with Ebola in the United States opens up broader questions on domestic public health issues.

Last month, a stopgap spending bill added additional funds for HHS and CDC Ebola research and response activities. This week, the Texas Ebola case caused CDC and state health officials to scramble to examine 100 people who had contact with the diagnosed patient. Also this week, Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz inquired about new FAA travel restrictions. Texas Republican Rep. Michael C. Burgess, who is also a physician, suggested an examination of the possibility of suspending travel from selected countries. CQ Roll Call's David Harrison reported (subscription) on the current CDC position, which allows travel from Africa.

The problems besetting the U.S. workforce are longstanding and structural, and incremental measures are unlikely to cure them. We need to understand the roots of wage stagnation -- and act boldly to counteract them.

But declining labor-force participation explains only a portion of this drop. Since 2000, corrected for inflation, the weekly earnings of full-time wage and salary workers at the median have declined slightly. And remarkably, average hourly wages adjusted for inflation are lower than they were 40 years ago.

The cost of benefits -- especially health care -- has been rising faster than wages. It is easy to conclude that total compensation has been rising briskly even if wages have stalled. But the facts don't bear out this conjecture.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-31Between 1981 and 2014, according to calculations based on the Bureau of Labor Statistics, wages corrected for inflation rose at the anemic rate of 0.3% a year. (At that pace, it would take 230 years for wages to double.) But total compensation -- wages plus benefits -- hasn't done much better, rising at only 0.6% a year. Workers feel stuck because they are stuck. When they look at an economy that has expanded much faster than their wages and benefits in recent decades and even since 2009, they have a right to ask: Where's our share and why haven't we gotten it?

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-31A recent special report by the Economist magazine offers a disturbing answer to this question. The report's author, Ryan Avent, assembles an impressive array of evidence for the proposition that advances in information and communications technology are destroying more jobs in advanced economies than the advances are creating. Two Oxford scholars, Carl Benedict Frey and Michael Osborne, recently concluded that 47% of employment in America "is at high risk of being automated away" over the next two decades. Computer-driven technological change, which began by reducing the labor required for mass production, is now hollowing out the job market, for even routine legal and accounting tasks.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-31Although opportunities are increasing for professional and high-skill technical workers, many mid-skill workers are being displaced and forced down the ladder to compete with low-skill workers, who are already a glut on the domestic and global market. This helps explain why labor's share of national income has declined since the 1980s, not only in the U.S., but throughout the developed world. If we exclude earners at the very top, who have garnered a rising portion of labor compensation during this period, the picture for average workers is even worse.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-31No doubt the latest technological wave has brought gains to average Americans as consumers. But the losses it has inflicted on average Americans as producers is far more consequential. The digital revolution, Mr. Avent concludes, is "opening up a great divide between a skilled and wealthy few and the rest of society." This poses a political challenge for governments throughout the developed world. If they get it right, Mr. Avent says, they will be able to "channel technological change in ways that broadly benefit society." If they get it wrong, they could be "under attack from both angry underemployed workers and resentful rich taxpayers," generating a "bitter and more confrontational politics."

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-31Up to now, our collective failure to understand the implications of the information and communications technology revolution for our economy, society and politics has allowed these problems to fester. Standard liberal and conservative narratives have lost much of their power. Tax cuts are no response to the technological challenge, but stronger unions would be only marginally more relevant. Americans have withdrawn trust from parties and institutions that seem incapable even of explaining our ills, let alone address them.

The business community favors upgrading K-12 education and the skills training that community colleges are getting better at providing. Many leaders in both parties favor increased public investments in areas -- such as infrastructure, energy efficiency and basic research -- that boost both growth and job creation. Entrepreneurs urge reforming the taxes and regulations that have slowed innovation and business startups in recent decades.

For the next decade or two, governments will have to act directly to boost take-home pay. Carefully calibrated minimum-wage increases, expanded wage subsidies and work-sharing programs such as Germany's should be regarded as essential parts of the public tool kit.

It is not an easy balance to strike, even in well-functioning political systems. Against the backdrop of our polarized, paralyzed national institutions, it will take leadership of exceptional clarity and skill to do what we must do.

References to music, history, philosophy, and art formed a key part W of the Nazi strategy to reverse the symptoms of ^ decline perceived after World War I. Allusions to great creators and their works were used as propaganda to remind the Volk to love and worship their nation. In the words of the French scholar Eric Michaud, author of The Cult of Art in Nazi Germany, the Nazis used culture "to make the genius of the race visible to that race." And to cap off these images of a great national culture, the Nazis heralded Adolf Hitler, the Führer, as an artistic leader.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-31As Michaud put it: "Hitler presented himself not only as a 'man of the people' and a soldier with frontline experi-ence (Fronterlebnis), but also and above all as a man whose artistic experience constituted the best guarantee of his ability to mediate the Volksgeist and turn it into the 'perfect Third Reich.'"

So war and culture went together in the National Socialist agenda. Art, said Hitler's propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels, "is no mere peacetime amusement, but a sharp spiritual weapon for war."

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-31To understand how Nazis employed culture to define and promote their broadest ambitions, I looked to German mass media, in particular the main Nazi newspaper, the Völkischer Beobachter, whose cultural pages I examined for the years 1920 to 1945. While the Nazi co-optation of many great figures in the Western intellectual tradition during these eventful years proves revealing, one need look no further than the party's claim on Friedrich Nietzsche to see how culture became entwined in the discourse of politics and war in the pages of Hitler's foremost propaganda outlet.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-31Fitting Nietzsche's ideas into a single worldview was no simple matter, but this was precisely the mission of the Völkischer Beobachter's editors and writers: to make even complex ideas such as Nietzsche's appear to coordinate with the main tenets of Nazism. Looking into the shifting terms with which the daily newspaper presented Nietzsche helps us toward understanding how the Nazi party attempted to place his biography and writings-along with the tradition of Kultur as a whole-at the service of the Nazi outlook.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-31In addressing the "Germanness" of Nietzsche, however, the cultural politicians of the party faced some difficulties. The newspaper did not try to verify Nietzsche's racial origins-as it did for many other Western creators, including and especially Wagner and Beethoven-despite the fact that he occasionally claimed to be of Polish heritage. But it did have to confront indications that the philosopher rejected nineteenth-century trends of nationalistic identification.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-31As one contributor to the Völkischer Beobachter wrote, there is "one important point in Nietzsche's mental atti- tude on which even his friends have remained silent, from which they tried to distance themselves as much as possible: this is the matter of Nietzsche's attitude toward Germanness and the state." The philosopher, according to the paper, had seen with "sharp eyes" that while the Second Reich had been formed, it still "remained a shell without content" under Otto von Bismarck's Realpolitik. To him, nationalism was the "illness of the century" because it "attempted to hide its emptiness." In his words, "Nationalism as it is understood today is a dogma that requires limitation."

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-31But the point to keep in mind, according to the Völkischer Beobachter, was the qualifying phrase: "as it is understood today." Nietzsche's opinions about the German state could be understood only with reference to this phrase-that is, as critiques of his own specific time, not as categorical rejections of German nationalism.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-31This opened the way for the newspaper to present Nietzsche as a fervent patriot and strong representative of "Germanness." In fact, the paper reminded, Nietzsche actually said of himself that "I am perhaps more German than the Germans of today." And he valued the "earnest, manly, stern, and daring German spirit." He knew that "there was still bravery, particularly German bravery," that is, "inwardly something different than the élan of our deplorable neighbors." Compared with the French essence, in particular, he was "consistently, strongly, and happily conscious of the virtues" of the German character. Above all, Nietzsche held that "it is German unity in the highest sense which we are striving for more passionately than for political reunification-the unity of the German spirit and life."

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-31Very few others "saw things so clearly" in those days, said the Völkischer Beobachter. As if on a mission to confirm the philosopher's Germanness, another contributor traveled to Sils-Maria, wandered the region, and ruminated on passages Nietzsche had written there. The landscape, Ernst Nickell reflected, is "consecrated by German fate and German tragedy." Nietzsche "needed this landscape; he had to stand near the highest things and the firmament"-because he was "German despite everything."

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-31Nietzsche was, however, rather ambivalent about politics, having called himself the "last anti-political German of them all." But Nazi propaganda rigorously promoted the view that the primary creative impulse was as much political as it was artistic. The picture of Nietzsche thus had to be corrected to bring out his political side.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-31The Völkischer Beobachter admitted that "we find here at first view a sharp contrast with today's [National Socialist] thinking"-but only at first glance. According to the paper, what Nietzsche understood by the term "state" was completely different from "our idea of the state today." For him, politicization meant democratization, i.e., the greatest good for the greatest number. This Nietzsche hated, the paper said, because "general prosperity would make mankind too lazy to invest powerful energy in a great individual- in a genius." That is why Nietzsche wanted "as little state as possible." A volkish state, directed according to Nazi ideology, however, would revive the genius of the nation, and therefore earn Nietzsche's support.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-31The paper acknowledged that Nietzsche had other views that seemed "the complete opposite of our views today." For instance, he viewed culture and the state as antagonists. This, perhaps, should have made him the oddest of conscripts to the Nazi campaign to subordinate culture to politics and war, but that was not the party line. Such ideas of Nietzsche's, the Völkischer Beobachter insisted, were likewise conditioned by his own times:

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-31The German Reich had had the misfortune to achieve its external form when there was no longer any inner content. The classical heights of German education had sunk, the song of German Romanticism sounded only from afar. On the other hand, Realism was on the rise, leading more and more toward materialism. Money and business had become the gods of the age.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-31A state as the "guardian and defender of culture; a state as the means of achieving the true goal of existence, not as a goal in itself; a state that is built on the Volk- that, Nietzsche would have accepted," the newspaper claimed. Therefore, the philosopher "would have agreed with today's [National Socialist] German idea of the state with all of his heart."

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-31Under the Weimar Republic, the Völkischer Beobachter complained, Nietzsche had been invoked far too frequently by "international-democratic literati" as a "star-witness" for their worldview. But, the paper countered, Nietzsche "hated and fought every form of democracy, both political and spiritual," and he said so in the sharpest possible terms. The notions that "all are the same" and that at base we are all just selfish brutes and riffraff-were symbolic of the democratic age that believed in the equality of men and that established "the weak, fat, and cowardly as standards for this equality."

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-31In Nietzsche's opinion, said the Völkischer Beobachter, this rule of the humble amounted to a blow against life itself. Against the democratic and supposedly feeble outlook of the Weimar era, the newspaper argued, Nietzsche set forth a way of thinking that sets laws for the futurean outlook which "handled contemporary things harshly and tyrannically" in the interest of the future.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-31Thus did the cultural-historical material that appeared in the Völkischer Beobachter resound with the Führer/ArtistArtist/Führer theme that typified Nazi cultural politics. Hitler was the primary manifestation of this creative leadership, but he came, according to this view, after a long line of notable predecessors, including Luther, Beethoven, Wagner, and, yes, Nietzsche.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-31Cultural renewal in accordance with such perceptions of intellectual history was a central premise of the larger project of the Third Reich, fundamental to Hitler's aims. But this agenda also contributed to the most destructive impulses of the movement. Indeed, German cultural identity as shaped by the Nazi regime did not merely justify anti-Semitism or policies of extermination, it led to them. Hitler's racist standards of judgment were grounded in cultural terms, as he stated in Mein Kampf : "If we were to divide mankind into three groups, the founders of culture, the bearers of culture, the destroyers of culture, only the Aryan could be considered as the representative of the first group." According to the Völkischer Beobachter, Jewish creators such as Heine, Meyerbeer, Mendelssohn, Mahler, and Schoenberg-among many others-supposedly belonged in the latter, so they and their kind had to be eradicated.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-31Demonstrating that great cultural figures of the past would have agreed with these premises was a priority in the Nazi newspaper. One contributor put it in these stark terms: "to win over to our movement spiritual leaders who think they see something distasteful in anti-Semitism, it is extremely important to present more and more evidence that great, recognized spirits shared our hatred of Jewry."

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-31In the case of Nietzsche, however, this process required a little more "spin" than the "selective scavenging" for biographical and textual evidence that scholar Steven Aschheim identified as the usual mode of such politicization. Some Völkischer Beobachter contributors recognized that Nietzsche had not been a committed anti-Semite, and had even criticized the anti-Semitic views of Richard Wagner, his own sister, Elisabeth, and her husband, Bernhard Förster. One editor, for instance, said about Nietzsche: "His work contains other crass contradictions and obscurities, especially in his treatment of the Jewish Question, where he sometimes confesses himself as an Anti-Semite, and then as a philo-Semite. Equally obscure is what he understood as race and nation. This may be a result of the eruptive nature of his creativity and the shortness of his life, which didn't allow him enough time to go into these issues deeply."

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-31But other contributors wrote as if aligning Nietzschean ideas with Nazi anti-Semitism posed no difficulties at all. One article listed carefully selected passages from Beyond Good and Evil to show that Nietzsche "expressed himself extraordinarily farsightedly on the Jewish Question." An article entitled "Nietzsche as Warner about the Jewish Danger" insisted that Nietzsche concerned himself with the Jewish Question, "as every clear thinking, every sensitive Aryan-German person must." Nietzsche, the paper said, recognized the danger threatening Germans in the form of a completely foreign and utterly different race, and "warned us-and like so many hundreds of great, significant men who warned us before him, he warned in vain!"

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-31Nietzsche, this article went on, saw how the Jews were becoming "ever more powerful" in Germany and Europe and expressed this in "prophetic words." Above all, the thought that the Jews "were determining what distinguishes"-in other words, that Jews had become important cultural arbiters-filled him with fright. For he knew that this would lead to a transvaluation of values, favoring "the development of the Jewish race, Jewish culture, and Jewish spiritual life-against German essence, German nature, and German culture." He saw a foreign race operating at the cost of his own German Volk; and to Nietzsche-"the man of action-it was incomprehensible that the whole German Volk wasn't arming itself with every weapon in order to save that which is most sacred, its volkish essence." Was Nietzsche an anti-Semite? the article asked rhetorically. "He was-he was in the most intrinsic, pure and sacred sense of the word!"

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-31National Socialist invocations of historical figures were intended as symbolic indications of what the New Germany would become. As Michaud put it, "the awakening into the myth" was "an awakening to the present"-a "recapitulation of the past directed toward the future." Citing Baldur von Schirach was an excellent way for Michaud to support this point. The future Hitler Youth leader stated, "The perfect artists Michelangelo and Rembrandt, and Beethoven and Goethe, do not represent an appeal to return to the past, but show us the future that is ours and to which we belong." The Völkischer Beobachter cultural section was dearly designed for the same reasons.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-31According to its longtime editor-in-chief, Alfred Rosenberg, the "German spirit" that inspired Nietzsche and about which he spoke with great hope had reawakened after the "darkness of the betrayal in 1918" in "the spirit of the Nazi Party." Therein, Rosenberg wrote (in his cryptic style), "a new idea of life" and a worldview that recognized the laws of this life came reverentially into light. In their own time, Rosenberg continued, "National Socialists were experiendng the effects of the forces that became a dangerous, destructive power in the nineteenth century and continued to threaten Europe as a "great outbreak of the most dreadful illness." Nietzsche "stands with us" and Nazis "greet him as a close relative in the formulation of a broadminded worldview, as a brother in the battle for the rebirth of a great German spirituality; as a herald of a European unity, and as a promoter of creative life in our ancient, yet-through a great revolution-rejuvenating continent."

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-31Similarly, Alfred Bäumler, who had been appointed Professor of Philosophy at the University of Berlin largely on the basis of his Nazified Nietzsche interpretations, wrote in the Völkischer Beobachter that the Volk which produced Nietzsche "was the only one that saw the greatest of all dangers threatening mankind." Nazis alone-in contrast to their enemies, who were "reviling the great thinker"- honored the philosopher who "wrestled a new, pure image of man out of confusion and degradation." Nietzsche, according to the leading Nazi Nietzschean, "foresaw and loved the idea we are protecting-that of the man whose innermost seed is bravery, the mother of all virtues; the man who believes: 'That which does not kill us, makes us stronger.'"

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-31Michaud made it clear that Nazi obsession with the cultural historical past was not a retrogressive "move," but a forward-looking call for action. The appropriation of the German tradition of Kultur was "quite the reverse of the work of mourning." It was a "process of reminiscence that asserted itself as faith in one's own power to reawaken the lost object"-that is, to "produce the New Man." The Völkischer Beobachter's identification of Nietzsche as having "foreseen and loved" the New Man of Nazism was utterly consistent with this theme-in fact, a culmination of National Socialist self-validation.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-31Ultimately, production of these Nazi "ideals" involved going to war. Given the horrible outcomes of Nazi military policy, it is natural to assume that the Second World War itself was the primary goal of the regime. But war itself was not the aim. It was a means to an end. And that end was the realization of the new German man in a renewed nation, modeled on an image of Germany as Kulturnationpostulated and popularized, in part, by Völkischer Beobachter cultural coverage.

As one contributor put it: "In the name of all conscientious front soldiers," every "shirker" should read the words of Nietzsche carefully. Visiting Nietzsche's grave, another claimed that he heard emitting from the site exhortations that Germans steel themselves for approaching conflict.

"I want to say something to you, my brothers in spirit! Life means fighting and suffering. Sorrow makes some weary and soft-but it strengthens the creator.

"What," the paper asked, "would he say to a phrase like 'No more war'?"

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-31Peace-that is, the ultimately stable realization of Nazi ideals-could only be achieved through "battle" and "victory." Elsewhere, the Völkischer Beobachter stipulated that Nietzsche constantly repeated that "struggle rules throughout nature-that life itself is an outcome of war." Nietzsche, in this view, "valued battle as the basis for all life-so much that he cried, 'Good old war sanctifies everything!'"

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-31Völkischer Beobachter readers were exhorted, therefore, to live by Nietzsche's teachings by either applying their own will to power or by willfully accepting fates determined by the National Socialist community. In this way, the paper smoothed out another difficulty that Nietzsche's ideas held for Nazi ideology: Individuals could demonstrate their will to power not by becoming creative leaders alone, but alternatively by "accepting the necessity of things," becoming a "part and tool of great world events," and even making the ultímate sacrifice-the "highest self-denial"-for one's Volk. In the years that Germany was gearing up for war, this reading of Nietzsche's concept of will to power was most appropriate for Nazism's militaristic plans.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-31The Völkischer Beobachter was ultimately designed to motivate action in this war, and regularly called on Nietzsche as a major source of inspiration in the struggle once it started. "What makes Nietzsche so valuable today," it proclaimed, is his "fearless acknowledgement of the strong personality that alone can lead toward redemption, and after which all the suffering millions yearn." Not only in Germany, but throughout Europe, "we address him as the preacher of action!" To "treat oneself harshly and tyrannically for the sake of the future of our Volk, that was one of the most important National Socialist requirements. "How often do we recite, in small gatherings, the words of [Nietzsche's] Zarathustra: 'And if ye will not be fates and inexorable ones, how can ye one day-conquer with me? ... For the creators are tough.'" Toughness, "for the sake of our Volk!"-that was what the Völkischer Beobachter felt readers should derive from Nietzsche in wartime.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-31As the Völkischer Beobachter covered it, in a 1944 memorial event on the occasion of Nietzsche's one hundredth birthday, Alfred Rosenberg gave a speech which even more directly (though still cryptically) associated him with twentieth century warfare. The National Socialist movement, according to Rosenberg, "stood as a unified whole against the rest of the world, just as Nietzsche stood as an individual against the violent forces of his time." The world of "despicable financiers and their henchmen, the passion whipped up by millions of envious Bolsheviks, the destructive work driven by the rage of the Jewish underworld, this all appeared shortly before the enormous purifying wave [i.e., Nazism] from the heart of Europe began to flow." Now, as Nietzsche had done alone, the "National Socialist panGerman Empire stood as a block of will" in the middle of this tremendous struggle, "serving in full consciousness the necessity of a great life"-the necessity of, in Nietzsche's phrase, a "European destiny."AUTHOR_AFFILIATIONDavid B.

Blurring past on the A303 thoroughfare that cuts heedlessly almost across the monument's very entrance, Stonehenge appears as a cluster of insignificant protrusions on the big, otherwise featureless plain; and yet, even from this profane and glancing vantage, the great-shouldered silhouette is so unmistakably prehistoric that the effect is momentarily of a time warp cracking onto a lost world.

Unique today, Stonehenge was prob- ably also unique in its own time, some 4,500 years ago - a stone monument modeled on timber precedents. Indeed, its massive lintels are bound to their uprights by mortise-and-tenon joints taken straight from carpentry, an eloquent indication of just how radically new this hybrid monument must have been. It is this newness, this assured awareness that nothing like it had existed before, this revelatory quality, that is still palpable in its ruined stones. The people who built Stonehenge had discovered something hitherto unknown, hit upon some truth, turned a corner - there is no doubt that the purposefully placed stones are fraught with meaning.

Stonehenge is the most famous relic of prehistory in Europe and one of the best known, most contemplated monuments in the world - and we have no clear idea what the people who built it actually used it for.

Recently, though, the search has led investigators farther afield, away from Stonehenge itself to the remains of a nearby Neo- lithic village on the one hand, and on the other to a craggy mountain peak in southwestern Wales. While no definitive answer has yet emerged, these two very different searches-in-progress have stirred tantalizing new possibilities.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-31STONEHENGE AROSE from a rich tradition of equally enigmatic structures. Henges- circular banks of earth paralleled by an internal ditchearth barrows and mounds, circular timber structures, monoliths, and circles and horseshoes of stone were all common throughout Neolithic Britain and parts of continental Europe. (Strictly speaking, Stonehenge is not, as its name implies, a henge, because the position of its bank and ditch are reversed.) At different stages of its evolution Stonehenge reflected many of these traditions. The first certain structural stones of Stonehenge, the bluestones, which were floated, dragged, and hauled from Wales, most likely arrived sometime before 2500 B.C. The giant sarsens followed, filling out the monument, which was at some point linked by an avenue to the River Avon. Stonehenge, then, is the culmination of a dynamic evolution; the pre-stone earthworks thrown up in grassland probably embodied different beliefs than the later monument of stone that was resolutely connected to water.

Easier to imagine are the actions that lie behind it: the planning and engineering; the diplomacy required to negotiate transportation of stones through different territories; the logistical maneuvering to supply and equip a labor force; the ability to cajole, inspire, or compel able-bodied men to leave their animals, fields, and hunting grounds - in short, the many necessary human acts that we still recognize, although we know little about who these early Britons were, how they were organized, or what language they spoke.

Skeletal remains indicate that despite physically demanding lives, the people of Neolithic Britain were more lightly built than us. Their relative lack of dental decay suggests a diet low in carbohydrates, and although life expectancies are difficult to calculate, people seem, overall, to have enjoyed good health. Then as now, life held unexpected hazards. "Five to 6 percent of these populations showed massive blunt-force trauma to the crania," according to Michael Wysocki, a senior lecturer in forensic and investigative science at the University of Central Lancashire. "This was equally the case between male and female." Explanations for this trauma range from ritualized violence to the possibility that life of the era was simply brutal.

In 2002 archaeologists working on Boscombe Down, on the east side of the Avon, two and a half miles southeast of Stonehenge, unearthed two burials dated at between 2500 and 2300 B.C. They contained the remains of a 35-to-45-year-old man whose leg had been badly damaged - he would have walked with a horrific limp - and a younger relative, perhaps his son. The older man's grave contained the richest burial goods of the era found in Britain: gold jewelry for hair, copper knives, flint tools, two archer's wrist guards of polished stone, a "cushion stone" for working metal, along with pottery of the distinctive Beaker style common at the time in continental Europe but not in Britain. Chemical analysis of the tooth enamel of both men gave startling results: The younger man was from the local chalk country of Wessex; the older man, dubbed the "Amesbury Archer," came from the foothills of the Alps in the region of what is now Switzerland and Germany.

The hard facts suggest a romantic story. Migrating from Europe, with his advanced pottery and his skills in metalworking, the Archer had made good in Wessex, acquiring considerable wealth and status along with a family.

Analysis of the premolars and molars of the three adults revealed, according to Fitzpatrick, "that they were in one place up to the age of six, and in another up to the age of thirteen." Matches for the place of infancy include northwestern Britain, Wales, or Brittany. "The larger point is not where they came from," Fitzpatrick emphasized, "it's that people of the era traveled. This is the best example of prehistoric migration in Europe yet found."

Since 2003 the Stonehenge Riverside Project, headed by Mike Parker Pearson of the University of Sheffield and five other team leaders and supported by the National Geographic Society, has been conducting a series of exca- vations of the wider Stone- henge landscape, focusing on a massive henge, some 1,500 feet in diameter, known as Durrington Walls. Nearly two miles northeast of Stone- henge, Durrington was known as early as 1812 and excavated in the 1960s ahead of road construction. Erosion and land use have now blurred its once formidable outlines, made of earth banks formerly as wide as one hundred feet and at least as high as ten.

Two - the Northern and Southern Circles - lay within the henge itself, while a later monument known as Woodhenge stood just outside. "There is evidence to suggest that timber circles were secretive places, their interiors hidden by screens as well as the multiplications of posts," said Alex Gibson, an authority on timber circles at the University of Bradford. Recently, inside the henge banks, the Riverside Project unearthed two structures, lofty and distinguished by individual ditches and palisades, perhaps residences of elite officials overseeing the circle, or even cult houses.

Tentatively dated at between 2600 and 2500 b.c, they straddle a hundred-foot-wide flint-paved avenue to the Avon. Standing inside the foundation outline of one of the houses, Mike Parker Pearson pointed out domestic details, such as an oval hearth in the middle of the floor. "These are heel, or maybe buttock, marks," he said, squatting by way of demonstration beside indentations on the plaster floor. Remains of a cooking area stood to one side. Five houses show evidence of furniture, including slot marks for the edges of wooden beds. Parker Pearson waved a hand toward the dark tree fringe in the distance. Trial excavations and geophysical surveys have detected a multitude of other possible hearths in the valley. "There may be as many as 300 houses," he said, making it the largest Neolithic settlement found in Britain.

In Malagasy culture, the ancestors are revered with stone monuments, signifying the hardening of bodies to bone and the enduring commemoration of death; wood, by contrast, which decays, is associated with transient life. Stone is ancestral and male, while wood, as Parker Pearson put it, is "soft and squishy, like women and babies." As he allows, no such gender distinction has yet been discerned in Britain, but its the same principle underlying Western commemorative practice: "You lay flowers on the grave, then you put up a tombstone."

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-31Guided by this model, Parker Pearson sees suggestive associations between Durrington Walls, with its denning wooden structures, and the hard monumentality of Stonehenge. Durrington has a path to the Avon that could be a ceremonial avenue, though it is just over 550 feet long, while that at Stonehenge runs a mile and three-quarters, and its processional character is defined by flanking ditches and banks.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-31To Parker Pearson, the contrasts are equally suggestive. Stonehenge is aligned on both the axis of the summer solstice sunrise and the winter solstice sunset, while the Southern Circle at Durrington Walls catches the winter solstice sunrise. A profusion of pottery and animal bone debris, especially of pigs, implies that Durrington Walls saw much feasting, while very little pottery has been found at Stonehenge. Scarcely any human remains have been found at Durrington, but 52 cremations and many other burials have been uncovered at Stonehenge, which may contain as many as 240-the largest Neolithic cemetery in England. Durrington, in this new theory, represents the domain of the living, and Stonehenge, the domain of the ancestral dead, with the two linked by seasonal processions along a route formed by the avenues and the river. The ashes of most of the dead would have been entrusted to the river. Other cremated remains, possibly the society's elite, were deposited ceremonially at Stonehenge itself.

It is the details of the new theory that are problematic. The assumption has always been that burial remains at Stonehenge were common only during the period of the pre-stone earthworks and timber structures, though Parker Pearson now believes they continued into the period of the stones. But environmental evidence from the immediate landscape around Stonehenge indicates the usual activities of the living, such as farming and grazing of animals, which do not seem compatible with a larger ritualized domain of the dead. And there is no agreement about when the sarsen stones arrived. Similarly, the date of the avenue leading from Stonehenge to the Avon, the necessary link between the two sites, needs to be resolved by more evidence. Filling in these gaps is crucial for any meaningful correlation of activities between the two sites.

Previous interpretations have taken the independent sites separately."

The erection of the bluestones marked a critical transition from the original timber settings toward the monument we have today. "Dusted with magic," is how one archaeologist described the famously atmospheric hills to me, in a region long known for its intriguing stone circles, dolmens, and other megalithic monuments. As long ago as 1923, specific outcrops around Carn Menyn, at the eastern end of the Preseli hills, had been identified as the bluestone source; subsequent geochemical work in 1991 refined this to roughly one square mile.

"It's perverse, really." Together with Geoffrey Wainwright, a distinguished authority on the Neolithic and the original excavator of Durrington Walls in the 1960s, Darvill began a systematic survey around Carn Menyn in 2001, accompanied by a small team of researchers from Bournemouth University, including Yvette Staelens, a senior lecturer. "It's a place where strange things happen," Staelens said of the hills. She described reaching the top of a sheer rock outcrop and finding a fox impaled on rock. "Guts and blood were spilling down-we think a large raptor must have dropped it. Strange things like that."

"The stones of Stonehenge didn't have to be quarried; they could be simply carried off." Up to six feet in height and four tons, the approximately 80 original bluestones-the exact number formerly located at Stonehenge is unclear-are mostly dolerite spotted with milky feldspar. Freshly cut and wet with rain, they do indeed glisten blue. Still, these are not the only striking stones within the British Isles. "Why did they bring these stones 250 miles to build Stonehenge?" Wainwright asked. "And why did they retain these stones throughout its structural history?"

As Staelens recalled, on the first day Wainwright and Darvill began their field survey, Wainwright laid his hand on a rock. "And it had rock art. The pair of them were very academic blokey about the discovery. Geoff said, 'Look at this, Tim.' Tim said, 'That looks important, Geoff.' They just stood there, very British low-key."

This much, however, is known: Perhaps as early as 4000 B.C., people were constructing monuments in this atmospheric area where rock pinnacles seem to pierce the sky and commemorating the site with motifs associated elsewhere with "special" sites. "In Neolithic times people are going to the Preseli hills and venerating them," was how one archaeologist put it.

Similarly, how the stones were transported has been hotly debated over the years. "That's a blue-collar question," Wainwright said, relishing what was clearly a well-rehearsed line, "and I am not an engineer." Although gla- cial drift may initially have worked the stones loose from the hills, an old theory that glaciers swept them onto Salisbury Plain has been discounted by modern studies; somehow people must have moved them. The shortest accepted route-by river and along the coast of Wales, across the Severn estuary, into the upper reaches of the Avon-is about 250 miles. It is impossible to judge just how remarkable a feat such transport was in its day. As Darvill points out, in continental Europe even more massive stones were being lugged around. "Increasingly, the 'unaccountable effort' argument is under attack," Darvill said. "The Grand Menhir in Brittany-what does it weigh? Three hundred and forty tons, something like that, and it was moved at least a few miles." Whether the stones were pulled by teams of men or oxen, on sleds with greased tracks, giant rollers of wood, or some other unsuspected means, Neolithic man evidently, as Darvill said, "had transportation sorted out."

Cam Menyn may have been a landmark charged with special meaning in a key overland route for trade or travel. Some claim the arrangement of the types of bluestone-dolerite, rhyolite, and tuff-at Stonehenge mirrors their natural arrangement on Cam Menyn. Then again, perhaps the very effort of transporting the stones or their exotic nature was the point-a kind of statement of ability and power.

Writing in the 12th century a.d., Geoffrey of Monmouth, in his rambling, gossipy meander through the history of the kings of Britain, gave a fanciful account of how Stonehenge was carried bodily-on the orders of the wizard Merlin, no less-from Ireland to Salisbury Plain, where it was set down to be a place of healing. The story may represent oddments of tenaciously preserved folk memory garbled by a long-in this case, 3,600-year-old-oral tradition; the stones of Stonehenge were, after all, brought from a far place in the west by seemingly magical means.

The sum of these two traditions posits Stonehenge as a kind of Lourdes of the prehistoric world. Among colleagues this healing theory has received a mixed, but cautiously interested, reception. "I mean, it's plausible," one expert said. Until further evidence comes to light, then, the trail returns to where it began, with only the most basic of hard facts: People had found something special in the Preseli hills and transported this to southern England.

If brought by river, the stones would have been dragged from the willow-and-sedge-lined banks of the Avon up to the site. Decoratively stippled, grooved and smoothed, the stones were erected in pairs to form a double arc and were perhaps also yoked by lintels that have since fallen away.

At some later date the giant sarsens of hard sandstone were dragged in from the Marlborough Downs, 20 to 30 miles away. Although subsequent ages would fiddle with the internal design, the erection of the sarsens-the great broad-shouldered guardians of the smaller stones from Wales-bestowed on Stonehenge its enduring aura of unassailable assurance. Mystifying as it is to us, there is no mistaking the confident purposefulness of its massive, monumental features.

Charcoal remains, pollens of weeds associated with crops, and, most valuably, snail shells-which can be matched to different habitats-show that the Stonehenge landscape was cleared, grazed, and farmed. Whatever its function, Stonehenge was embedded in the community it served. "I see it being used like a cathedral, or Wembley Stadium," Allen said. "Some days it was used to hold solemn rituals, other days for more ordinary gatherings."

Projected work on the avenue could establish when it was extended to the Avon, clarifying at what stage the river became ritually linked to the monument. Cremation remains that were excavated and reburied at the monument as long ago as 1935 could benefit from rigorous new analysis with up-todate technology. In April Timothy Darvill and Geoffrey Wainwright conducted a two-week dig inside the stone circle-the first such excavation in decades-hoping to pin down when the bluestones arrived. Their planned reexamination of skeletal remains from the Stonehenge region may indicate whether a high percentage of the people had been in need of "healing." Fieldwork already under way in the Preseli hills may yield datable burial finds, possibly shedding light on the significance of the Preseli stones.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-31TO ALL THOSE who seek to read the meaning of Stonehenge in its stones, ritual texts from the dawn of history offer cautionary tales. Take, for example, a random Late Bronze Age text of ritual practice from the Luwians, who lived in what is now Turkey between roughly 1700 B.C. and 800 B.C.: "Then they hold it [the sheep] out to him and he spits into its mouth twice. The Old Woman speaks as follows, 'Spit out pain and woe, the god's anger. ..." Then they bring a piglet of dough and a living piglet. They wave the living piglet at some distance." It is fair to say that no diligent fieldwork or application of logic and reason could have led even a visionary archaeologist to reconstruct this ritual from artifacts like bones and ceramics. There are no texts to explain Stonehenge. Secure in its wordless prehistory, it can thus absorb a multitude of "meanings": temple to the sun-or the moon, for that matter; astronomical calendar; city of the ancestral dead; center of healing; stone representation of the gods; symbol of status and power. The heart of its mystique is, surely, that it excites in equal measure both zealous certitude and utter bafflement.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-31Stonehenge represented the end of the grand tradition of monument building in Neolithic England. It fell out of use around 1500 b.c, and over the centuries many of its stones toppled, broke, or were carried off- casualties of nature as well as man. From time to time reports were made about the enigmatic ruins. A first-century B.C. Greek historian, Diodorus of Sicily, cites a lost account set down three centuries earlier, which described "a magnificent precinct sacred to Apollo and a notable spherical temple" on a large island in the far north, opposite what is now France. (Apollo, intriguingly, is the god of healing.)

His account still resonates today. The stones, he wrote, were "as prodigious as any tales I ever heard of them and worth going this journey to see. God knows what their use was."

This earthwork is the "henge" in Stonehenge, though most Neolithic henges were built with the ditch inside the bank. Timber posts may have stood in some of the 56 circular pits that lined the bank's inner edge.

In a horseshoe configuration Inside the circle towered five freestanding trilithons, each formed of two upright stones linked by a lintel. The tallest reached 25 feet. The chalk bank was recut, small circular earthworks were added, and a banked avenue ran nearly two miles to the River Avon.

Durrington Walls (foregrouhd), a henge nearly two miles northeast of Stonehenge and 20 times larger, once held circular timber monuments, as did adjacent Woodhenge. Cryptic trenches like the Cursus are numerous in Britain. Avenues from Stonehenge and Durrington Walls to the River Avon suggest to some scholars that the sites were ritually linked.

Clues are being found in a recently unearthed Neolithic village at Durrington Walls-the largest known in Britain-tentatively dated at between 2600 and 2500 B.C. Archaeologist Mike Parker Pearson believes the perhaps 300 wattle-and-daub houses, with wooden beds and hearth-warmed plaster floors, were seasonally occupied when people gathered for the winter and summer solstices.

Made of soft copper from France and Spain, they were likely duller than the flint knives typical of the age, and may have been used only for ceremony.

Isotopic tooth analysis shows that the "Amesbury Archer," unearthed in 2002, grew up in the Alps. He was buried around 2400 B.C. with metalworking tools, a quiver of fine arrows, and the earliest gold yet found in Britain-hair ornaments (lower left). What brought him to within a few miles of Stonehenge at its height? Another mystery.

Local folklore attributes healing power to springs gushing from the hills, and some researchers speculate that's why the stones were moved 250 miles east. Stonehenge may have been a place of healing.

Their quarrying and transport along a land and water route of 250 miles (map, left) required coordination among several populations. But more than a thousand years earlier, people in the Preseli Mountains were already moving stones, building tombs like one at Pentre Ifan (right), foreshadowing what was to come.
