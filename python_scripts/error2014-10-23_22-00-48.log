Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-23 Sept. 22--Wet Nose  Volunteer  Terry Tubbs spent Friday afternoon in the cat cuddling room at Decatur Animal Services, playing with Moe, Ziggy and Sherry, a trio of kittens.  

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-23  "They're shy," Tubbs said. "They didn't do much today, but still it's an  important  step to get them socialized."  General Electric retiree Steve Underwood walked large dogs in a yard at the shelter at Wilson Morgan Park.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-23  "Monday, I posted that we were out of newspapers, and by Tuesday we had 10 big bags of newspapers," King said.  

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-23  Tubbs, Underwood and King, all Decatur residents, are three of the 35  volunteers  who show up regularly to help meet the needs of the animals,  volunteer  coordinator Helen Debuty said.  

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-23  Debuty said  volunteers  put in 400 hours of free work at Decatur Animal Services in August alone. Some show up once a month, while others come weekly or nearly every day, she said.  

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-23  Following last Monday's 4-1 City Council vote supporting Mayor Don Kyle's request to fire Decatur Animal Services Director Carol Wicks,  volunteers  wondered whether the shake-up would lead to changes in their role.  

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-23  "We all just want the best for the animals, and I think it will all be just fine," Tubbs said.  

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-23  King said she remains "cautiously optimistic."  

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-23  Complaints by Kyle and the DAS advisory board, headed by local veterinarian Dr. Steven Osborne, included allegations that Wicks didn't exercise appropriate control of monetary and in-kind donations, and created liability issues by allowing some  volunteers  to have keys to the facility.  

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-23  Osborne said he doesn't foresee major changes for  volunteers .  

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-23  "There may be changes like, instead of you having a key to the facility ... if you take a dog, you check out a key before you take it and check it back in the next day," he said. "The  volunteers  are going to have an active role. We want their participation. They save the city a ton of money."  

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-23  Kyle said changes will be made to how donations are handled. Monetary donations to Wet Nose  Volunteers  will be kept in a separate lockbox from donations to DAS, and city employees won't handle the money or have access to it, Kyle said.  

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-23  Debuty said she came out of Thursday's meeting with interim Director Danny Melson reassured changes would be minor.  

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-23  "(The  volunteers  are) real    important ," Melson said. "They spend a lot of time with the animals that the employees can't."  

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-23  The shelter has seven full-time staff members and four temporary employees.  

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-23  When Kyle placed Wicks on administrative leave Aug. 20, he had the locks on the building changed.  

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-23  Debuty said only about four  volunteers  had keys.  

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-23  "I turned mine in, but they'd already changed the locks, so it wasn't going to do any good anyway," she said.  

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-23  Wicks and Kyle had a public disagreement last fall after Kyle sent Wicks an email mandating the shelter reduce the number of animals to 45 within 30 days. Wicks said she could not meet the mayor's demand without euthanizing many of the 291 animals then living at the shelter.  

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-23  Some  volunteers  appeared at Wicks' hearing to decry her termination, and longtime Wet Nose  Volunteer  Ginger Speidel addressed the Council in Wicks' defense.  

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-23  Councilman Charles Kirby, who serves as DAS liaison, said some  volunteers  indicated they won't be further involved.  

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-23  Debuty said she was unaware of any  volunteers  who plan to quit.  

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-23  "Most realize they're  volunteers  because of their love of animals, and once they get over the turmoil, they realize why they got into it to begin with," Debuty said. "It's unfortunate that all of this happened, but we're there because of the animals."  

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-23  One silver lining: "Since all of this has been going on, I've gotten a lot of requests to take the class" to become a  volunteer , Debuty said.  

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-23  Debuty said she holds  volunteer  orientation classes about once a month. One class is held for  volunteers  who work with dogs and one for "cat cuddlers."  

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-23  Taking a class does not make one a full-fledged  volunteer .  

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-23  "They have to shadow one of the experienced  volunteers  on two occasions. There is just so much to learn," Debuty said.  

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-23  

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-23 Volunteers  may choose to work with large dogs or small. Cat cuddlers have to spend time with the cats on three occasions.  

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-23  It sounds simple enough, but most don't make the cut, Debuty said.  

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-23  "If I get 20 percent of the ones that take the class that actually come back and are dependable  volunteers , I'm doing good," she said. "Most people, when they realize that we don't just play with the puppies and kittens -- that they have to clean kennels and separate newspapers and wash food dishes and wash towels -- they don't ever come back."  

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-23  Other duties include taking animals to off-site events, walking dogs, brushing cats and bathing animals.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-23 Volunteers  also hold fundraisers to offer reduced prices on adoptions.  

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-23  Tubbs said she joined the  volunteers  last September after going to the shelter to adopt two cats for her daughter and grandson.  

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-23  At the time, the shelter was crowded, leading to the dispute between Kyle and Wicks. Debuty said cat cuddlers started around that time because the numerous felines in kennels stacked three deep rarely got any human interaction.  

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-23  "We know we can't save them all. We can't help every single one of them ... but if you've helped just one or two, that's something," Tubbs said.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-23 Volunteers  leave remarks on comment cards about each animal to encourage potential adopters. Some people are looking for more sedentary animals, while others are looking for lively ones, so any information about an animal's personality helps, said Tubbs, who puts in three to four hours each week petting and playing with cats.  

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-23  "I think it's as therapeutic for the people as it is for the animals," Tubbs said. "This is one of the highlights of my week."  

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-23  Underwood, who walks dogs two or three days a week, said he feels similarly about spending time with the canines.  

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-23  "They live in the moment, and when you're around them, you live in the moment, too," Underwood said. "It's hard to think of anything negative with that dog beside you."  

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-23  King said she looks forward to puppy kisses when she visits the shelter Saturdays to photograph dogs available for adoption and make flyers.  

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-23  "I think it's  important  that the community be involved in the welfare of the animals. Somebody has to do it," she said.

Medication is the most common biological treatment. Tranquilizers and sedatives may be prescribed to reduce anxiety and distress. Antidepressants are sometimes used to treat affective disorders. Stimulants, which speed up bodily processes, have been used for depression and, ironically, overactivity in children. Antipsychotic drugs are used to reduce excitement, confusion, thought disorders, and hallucinations. Use of these medications has permitted many patients to return to the community rather than remain in institutions.

ECT has been used to reduce the symptoms of depression. With the development of increasingly effective medications, today ECT is less frequently used for affective disorders.

Because such surgery is irreversible and usually develops no new adaptive behaviors, it is rarely used.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/103/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-24Canada's nationhood is in many ways a by-product of the AMERICAN REVOLUTION, when the victory of the Thirteen Colonies led to the exodus of LOYALIST Americans to BRITISH NORTH AMERICA. Many brought with them a deep distrust of the United States and its political system. Many American revolutionaries thought the revolution incomplete while Britain retained any North American outpost. Conflict seemed inevitable, and the Napoleonic Wars spilled over into North America in 1812. The WAR OF 1812 was fought defensively by the British and halfheartedly by the Americans.

The RUSH-BAGOT AGREEMENT of 1817 limited the presence of armed vessels on the Great Lakes. The CONVENTION OF 1818 provided for continuation of the boundary from Lake of the Woods to the Rocky Mountains. In the east, commissioners appointed under the Treaty of Ghent sorted out boundary problems, except in northern Maine.

William Lyon MACKENZIE and Louis-Joseph PAPINEAU sought American support in their REBELLIONS OF 1837. After his defeat Mackenzie fled to the United States, where he fomented border troubles for the following year (see HUNTERS' LODGES). A British show of military force and American official unwillingness to support the rebels ended the threats to British North America. In 1842 the ASHBURTON-WEBSTER TREATY settled the northeastern boundary, but problems west of the Rockies were cleared up in the 1846 OREGON TREATY only after war threatened.

Northern Americans resented what they felt was Britain's pro-Southern sympathy. British North America and the United States managed to avoid military confrontation, but the end of the war led to new tensions because it was thought that the North might take revenge against Britain, and because FENIANS were organizing to invade British North America. The Fenian Raids of 1866 failed, but spurred British North America toward CONFEDERATION the following year.

Prime Minister Sir John A. MACDONALD, a member of the British negotiating team, grumbled about the terms, but the treaty was useful to Canada in that the United States, through its signature, acknowledged the new nation to its north. Thereafter, Canada's concern about the American military threat diminished rapidly. There were fears of American interference as Canada established sovereignty over the North-West, but by the late 1890s both nations looked back at 3 decades of remarkably little conflict.

The commission broke down, with only minor matters settled. One question on which agreement was not reached was the ALASKA BOUNDARY DISPUTE, for which another tribunal was established 1903 and which led to Canadian anger, more toward Britain than against the United States. It produced a conviction that in the future Canada must rely increasingly on its own resources and less on Britain.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/103/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-24Canada therefore undertook to establish direct institutional links with the United States. Best known was the INTERNATIONAL JOINT COMMISSION, established 1909. In 1911 Prime Minister Wilfrid LAURIER went farther than most Canadians would go when he proposed a reciprocity agreement with the United States. In the 1911 election campaign old animosities reappeared, the Conservatives were elected and reciprocity died. Nevertheless, new Prime Minister Robert BORDEN quickly reassured the Americans that he wanted to maintain good relations. Borden's action probably eased tensions when Canada entered WORLD WAR I in 1914 while the United States remained neutral. When the United States finally entered the war in 1917, the 2 countries recognized their common heritage and interests to an unprecedented extent.

With Prime Minister Mackenzie KING's Liberals in power, there was an ever stronger tendency to emphasize Canada's "North American" character and, by implication, its similarity to the United States.

Canadian defence plans were altered as planners dismissed the possibility of conflict. Economic and cultural linkages strengthened as suspicion of American influence receded. Canada and the United States established legations in 1926 and no longer dealt with each other through British offices. More important was the impact of American popular culture through radio, motion pictures and the automobile. The Canadian government tried to regulate BROADCASTING and FILM but largely failed. Other organizations such as the Roman CATHOLIC Church in QuÃ©bec tried moral suasion and political pressure to prevent Canadians from partaking of the most frivolous aspects of American culture.

In 1938, as another European war loomed, he publicly promised support if Canada was ever threatened. Roosevelt did co-operate closely after WORLD WAR II erupted in September 1939. Although the United States remained neutral, Roosevelt and King reached 2 important agreements that formalized the American commitment: the Ogdensburg Agreement (1940) established the PERMANENT JOINT BOARD ON DEFENCE and the Hyde Park Agreement (1941) united the 2 economies for wartime purposes (see LEND-LEASE). Both agreements won widespread popular approval.

Public-opinion polls indicated that many Canadians would have liked to join the United States. This new affection frightened King, but Canada retained and even expanded defence and other relations with the United States after the war. The COLD WAR with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics convinced most Canadians that the United States was the bulwark defending common values and security. In August 1958 Canada and the United States signed a plan for joint air defence (NORAD), and the following year agreed to the Canada-US Defence Production Sharing Program.

Vincent MASSEY and Walter GORDON headed royal commissions on culture and economic policy that were critical of American influence in Canada. In Parliament, the 1956 PIPELINE DEBATE and the debate on the SUEZ CRISIS indicated that some parliamentarians also feared American influence upon Canada's government and its attitudes.

Nevertheless, he lamented Canada's increasing distance from Britain and the extent of American cultural and other influence. This feeling became suspicion of the United States itself when John Kennedy became president in 1961. The leaders disliked each other, and policy differences grew rapidly. Diefenbaker refused nuclear arms for Canada (see BOMARC MISSILE CRISIS) and hesitated to back Kennedy during the 1962 CUBAN MISSILE CRISIS. The Americans openly accused Diefenbaker of failing to carry out commitments. In the 1963 general election, Diefenbaker accused the Americans of gross interference, blaming them for his election loss.

By 1965, however, relations had deteriorated significantly as Prime Minister Lester PEARSON and Canadians found it difficult to give the United States the support it demanded during the VIETNAM WAR. By 1967 the Canadian government openly expressed its disagreement with American policies in Southeast Asia. Canadians generally became less sympathetic to American influence and foreign policy. A nationalist movement demanded that American influence be significantly reduced. The first major nationalist initiatives occurred in cultural affairs, but those most offensive to Americans, such as the NATIONAL ENERGY PROGRAM, were economic.

It was evident that the government of Pierre TRUDEAU and the administration of Ronald Reagan perceived international events from a different perspective. Canada, nevertheless, did permit cruise missile testing despite strong domestic opposition. In 1984 the election of Brian MULRONEY's Conservatives signalled a reconciliation with the United States, one which led to a weakening of nationalistic legislation and agencies such as the FOREIGN INVESTMENT REVIEW AGENCY (FIRA). Canadian public opinion did not reject these initiatives, and polls in 1985 and 1986 even showed strong support for FREE TRADE, though this support declined in 1987.

This agreement became the central issue of the Canadian general election of 1988 which the Mulroney Conservatives decisively won. The trade agreement quickly came into effect, and Canadian-American economic relations were fundamentally changed. In 1994 the trade agreement was extended to Mexico and became known as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).

Moreover, the disparity in size between the two partners meant that on truly controversial issues in the United States Congress, such as softwood lumber, the Canadian government had to give way. Nevertheless, trade between the 2 countries grew dramatically with the United States taking 80% of Canada's exports by 1995 and Canada receiving 70% of its imports from the United States. These figures lead many observers to conclude that Canada has cast its fate to North American winds. Some spoke of an inevitable political integration as a result.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/103/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-24Relations worsened again during the presidency of George W. Bush. After the attacks on New York and Washington on 11 September 2001, Canada committed troops to the INTERNATIONAL CAMPAIGN AGAINST TERRORISM IN AFGHANISTAN. When the Americans extended the war to Iraq in 2003, Canada refused to take part in the new campaign. The tensions became public when the United States ambassador publicly rebuked Canada and when some Canadian officials made derogatory remarks about the United States president. The situation further deteriorated when Canada announced in 2005 that it would not participate in the United States program to build a ballistic missile defence system. The inauguration of Barack Obama as United States president in January 2009 encouraged hopes for improved relations between the 2 countries.

In fact, as anyone even superficially acquainted with his career must know, Malcolm was not an advocate of violence:

If we're dealing with a non-violent enemy, then we would be non-violent, too. But as long as our people in this country have to face the continued acts of brutality on the part of the racist element in the North as well as in the South, then I don't think that we should be called upon to be non-violent. When they'll get non-violent, we'll get non-violent.

But its justice is irrelevant to the ruling class; any form of effective resistance to oppression enrages those hypocrites who themselves do not hesitate to use whatever forms of violence are necessary to maintain the exploitation of the mass of Negroes. Violence against Negroes is standard operating procedure; it is unthinkable that Negroes should defend themselves.

This was because, unlike Empress Wu, Mao's economic policies, such as the "Great Leap Forward" (a campaign to modernize China's economy that lasted from 1958 to 1961), had caused famine, disorder, and widespread economic decline. Moderate CCP leaders stepped in with more pragmatic plans, and these did help China recover. Mao, however, was dismayed at what he saw as backsliding away from his cherished Communist ideals.

The popularity of this new drink made of the fruit of a plant of Ethiopian origin spread rapidly, and within a decade coffee was being consumed widely throughout the Islamic world. all the evidence suggests that this new drink was first used by Sufi orders of Yemen.

The reason for this was simple - Sufi orders were not like the closed monastic orders of their Christian counterparts; adherents continued to work and enjoy family life. Consequently, the only time they had for their devotional rituals was at night.

This is also mirrored in the classic Ethiopian coffee ceremony where the participants' enjoyment of the magical aroma of the roasted bean is an integral part of the ritual.

Then, in a well reasoned section of this book, the author sets out an argument against the belief that coffee drinking began in Ethiopia based on the historical record - or rather the absence of it.

Produced by poor tropical countries - mainly at the behest of European colonial powers - and consumed in rich temperate countries, coffee has today become one of the world's most valuable legally traded commodities.

And the production of coffee did not compete with sugar, it did in fact complement it as coffee flourished in the previously uncultivated mountainous regions.

The French - who Wild says made the distinct mistake of colonising the inferior Robusta type of coffee producing countries of West Africa - formed an affection for this bean's particular taste "that stands in stark contrast to their discernment respecting other foodstuffs". he goes on to comment that the Dutch still prefer the heavy body and low acidity of Indonesian coffees.

Neuroplasticity is how we adapt to changing conditions, learn new facts, and develop new skills. If the brain is injured, it tries to repair itself with these normal mechanisms. If all goes well, spontaneous recovery can be excellent. Of course, the natural scope of these plastic processes is limited, and sometimes the end point of the remodeling is problematic itself. The job for those of us interested in rehabilitation is to promote plasticity in the right direction and, sometimes, to correct it if it has taken a wrong turn. We must, therefore, understand neuroplasticity and learn to control it. Fortunately, this is an active area for current research.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-24Neuroplasticity can be understood at several levels. The first level is that of the individual neuron and the events responsible for remodeling that occur within the cell. The second level is that of groups of neurons and their functions that can change to alter behavior. At the cellular level, multiple processes can occur both in parallel and serially. Generally speaking, some processes are quick, but transient, and can allow for rapid adaptations. Others take longer, but are then more permanent. One principle appears to be that the more persistent an early change is, the more likely it is that it will be permanent.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-24The fastest type of change is a simple modulation of neuronal traffic that leads to a change in the amount of excitation and inhibition. Apparently, many neural networks are chronically and largely inactive because of tonic inhibition. Release of this inhibition will allow the networks to function; a process sometimes called "unmasking." Unmasking can be demonstrated in animal models with local delivery of gamma-amino-butyric acid antagonists, which immediately opens new functional networks [1].

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-24Another relatively rapid change involves alteration of the strength of specific synapses. The magnitude of the response of the synapses changes as a function of the pattern of activity that they experience, both at the individual synapse and at the temporal conjunction of two or more synapses on the same cell. The most wellknown of these processes are long-term potentiation (LTP), which is an increase in synaptic strength, and long-term depression (LTD), which is a decrease in synaptic strength [2]. After only minutes of synaptic activity, there can be changes that last hours or are relatively permanent. The molecular and cellular biologies of LTP and LTD are being intensively studied, and a fascinating set of cellular processes have been discovered, which are triggered and regulated by the influx of calcium at the active synapses. It is important to recognize as well that a decrease in inhibition will facilitate changes in synaptic strength, and this links unmasking to LTP and LTD.

Some spines appear to come and go relatively quickly. Of course, when there are more long-lasting anatomical changes, a plastic process is more secure.

One method for studying unmasking is acute deafferentation, which can be induced by peripheral ischemia. When employing this method, we commonly use a blood pressure cuff inflated over a subject's elbow; within minutes, nerve traffic begins to lessen, and it disappears completely within 20 to 30 min. This deafferentation appears to cause a decrease in inhibition in the local region of the motor cortex, where the neurons are located that innervate the deafferented part of the body and its adjacent parts. We can readily study this response by observing the rapid increase in excitability of the cortical motor representations that control adjacent body parts with the application of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Using microneurography, we demonstrated that the deafferented area itself shows an increase in excitability [5]. When there is peripheral deafferentation for longer periods, as is seen with amputation or spinal cord injury, other mechanisms are triggered that cause more permanent changes. However, these more permanent changes can go awry, as seen by the phenomenon of phantom pain [6].

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-24A number of human models are being used for the study of longer-term neuroplastic changes, which may be the result of changes in synaptic strength or synaptic remodeling. Motor learning can be modeled (or "studied") with the use of a variety of motor tasks from simple pinching to moving the thumb in one direction to more complex skills such as movement sequences. The early events focus on the motor cortex, where increases in metabolic activity are measured with neuroimaging and changes in muscle excitability with TMS [7]. Motor learning can have some permanence, and some aspects of it are similar to LTP and LTD.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-24Another set of models for longer-term changes are those that artificially modulate neuronal traffic to regions such as the motor cortex. Repetitive TMS at rates of &#8805;5 Hz lead to increases in excitability, while rates of &#8804;1 Hz can lead to loss of inhibition. Use of the theta burst stimulation technique to pattern the stimuli may be even more effective [8]. The application of direct current to the brain with a technique called direct current transcranial stimulation can also lead to increases and decreases in excitability, depending on whether the anode or cathode is placed over the motor cortex [9]. Additionally, paired stimuli at the motor cortex, such as a median nerve stimulus combined with TMS (a technique called paired afferent stimulation), can lead to excitation or inhibition, depending on the interval between the stimuli [ 10].

Body parts can compete for representation in the brain and use of a body part can enhance its representation. Representation areas increase or decrease depending on use. A good example is Braille readers who use their fingers many hours a day in the skilled task of interpreting Braille characters [11]. In this situation, the first dorsal interosseus (FDI) is used for reading, while the adductor digiti minimi (ADM) is largely passive. Using TMS mapping, we did not find significant differences between the motor representations of right and left FDI and ADM in control subjects. However, in proficient Braille readers, the representation of the FDI in the reading hand was significantly larger than that in the nonreading hand, or in either hand of the control subjects. Conversely, the representation of the ADM in the reading hand was significantly smaller than that in the nonreading hand, or in either hand of the control subjects. These results suggest that the cortical representation of the reading finger in proficient Braille readers is enlarged at the expense of the representation of other fingers. Conversely, if a body part is not used, its representation area shrinks. For example, the representation area of the tibialis anterior is smaller after the ankle is immobilized in a cast for several weeks [12].

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-24While the primary motor cortex has the largest and most powerful contribution to the function of the corticospinal tract, the premotor cortex also contributes. We know, from both anatomical and physiological studies, that there are contributions of the premotor cortex to the function of the corticospinal tract, but stimulation thresholds of the premotor cortex are higher than that of the primary motor cortex. So, while the main output of the premotor cortex is ordinarily to the primary motor cortex, the premotor cortex can also be the source of supraspinal control signals [14].

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-24Although rather weak in humans, there are ipsilateral, corticospinal neural pathways. Although these pathways innervate many more proximal than distal muscles, they can be documented in normal humans, even in distal muscles, with the use of TMS [15]. Such pathways are necessarily involved in recovery of patients with hemispherectomy. Although controversial, these pathways may possibly be relevant in stroke recovery [16]. Another possible role of the undamaged hemisphere could be its interactions with the damaged hemisphere; there are transcallosal connections that are not completely characterized. Some of these transcallosal connections are inhibitory, and improvement might occur if these connections were themselves inhibited. Functional magnetic resonance imaging studies show that the damaged hemisphere has increased blood flow when bilateral movements are made; these data are consistent with the idea that activity of the undamaged hemisphere might support the damaged hemisphere [17]. Another possibility is that the ipsilateral hemisphere helps with activity of the premotor cortex rather than the motor cortex itself [18].

This concept has been most fully demonstrated by the multiple successes of constraintinduced (CI) movement therapy. This method forces patients to use the hemiplegic limb by constraining the good limb [19]. In a number of clinical trials, patients have shown behavioral improvement with the use of CI, even those with chronic and apparently stable deficits. TMS maps of the weakened muscles increase in size in these circumstances, which shows that the expected cortical changes appear to be occurring [20]. Other techniques, such as neuromuscular electrical stimulation [21], robot-enhanced training [22], and virtual reality training [23] likely use the same principle.

Sensory stimulation can be applied in a number of ways from passive movement to cutaneous stimulation with transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation and even to acupuncture. Stimulation of the pharynx may improve swallowing function [26].

In general, studies indicate that the combination is important; drugs by themselves seem not to be efficacious. The most fully documented improvements are with amphetamine and related noradrenergic agents. Drug therapy was first demonstrated to be valuable in a rat model; now several clinical trials show that amphetamine, together with physical therapy, is better than physical therapy alone [27]. The mechanism for this drug action is not completely clear. While it is possible that it works by relieving diaschisis, amphetamine also enhances plastic changes in motor learning in both animals and humans [28]. Evidence has also been found for enhanced neural sprouting and synaptogenesis [29]. Now other agents, such as fluoxetine, methylphenidate, and levodopa, have been shown to be of use.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-24For the future, a variety of innovative methods may well emerge that take advantage of plastic processes. An example is a technique that we have been exploring that uses exercise together with local anesthesia. After hemiplegic stroke, significant function is often lost in the hand, while strength is retained in the proximal arm muscles. Since competition exists between body parts for representation in the motor cortex, it is possible that use of the proximal muscles makes it difficult for hand muscles to increase their representation. We know that peripheral deafferentation increases the excitability of proximal muscles, and recently we have demonstrated that this increase is magnified by exercise of the proximal muscles during the peripheral block [30]. We reasoned that anesthesia of proximal muscles and exercise of the hand might increase cortical representation of the hand and concomitantly improve hand function. Preliminary results suggest that this may indeed occur [31]. Other techniques may utilize brain stimulation methods to improve rehabilitation [32].

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25A time-lapse movie of earth's history compressed into a few minutes would show continents smashing into each other and mountains being pushed up on some parts of earth, while other continents just slide past each other. A few continents would rip apart, and vast oceans would rush in to fill the gap. According to the theory of plate tectonics, the earth's surface has been shaped and molded in this way over millions of years.    The earth's crust is not just one unbroken covering, but a series of continually moving slabs (called plates) consisting of land or ocean floor. As the plates move, their edges can ram into each other, causing spectacular volcanoes and earthquakes. The plates float on the earth's mantle, a hotter and more fluid layer of rock. Below the mantle is earth's hottest part--the dense core.    As the earth's core heats the bottom of the mantle, columns of hot rock rise slowly to the top. At the same time, columns of cooler, denser (and heavier) rock at the top gradually sink to the bottom at another part of the mantle. This movement produces circular currents that carry the floating plates--as a conveyor belt in a supermarket carries food. Plates move very slowly, generally creeping along at a rate of up to 5 centimeters (2 in) a year. That's about as fast as your fingernails grow.    Plates are made up of either of two different crust types: continental and oceanic. The crust that forms the continents is thicker and lighter than the crust that forms the ocean floor. Most plates consist of both crust types. When oceanic crust collides with continental crust, the oceanic crust generally is subducted--that is, it slides--under the continent.    The leading edge of subducted crust melts into earth's mantle. The molten rock is lighter than the solid rock of the continent that is on top of it, so it rises and melts through the continental crust, often causing volcanoes and earthquakes. Such movement is now occurring (among other places) along the Ring of Fire of the Pacific Rim and along the Mediterranean Belt that stretches from central Asia to southern Europe.

The San Andreas fault in California is the boundary between two such sliding plates. The North American plate carries most of North America, and the Pacific plate carries the Pacific Ocean floor and a small slice of North America, including part of California. The Pacific plate moves about 5 centimeters (2 in) northward each year. The edges of the plates are not smooth, and the plates can sometimes snag on each another. Pressure builds until the plates lurch past each other and an earthquake rocks the land. The San Francisco earthquake of 1906 opened a 5.5-meter (18-ft) gap in a road that crossed the San Andreas fault.    When two plates of continental crust crash head on, neither can sink into the earth's mantle. The force of the collision squeezes the crust, folding it and pushing it up into mountain ranges. That is one way that fossils of sea creatures can turn up at the tops of mountains. When the continental collision pushes up the shallow sea floor along the edges of a continent, fossilized remains of dead marine organisms in rocks are carried up into the new mountain ranges.    If some plates melt down into the mantle while others get pushed up, it would seem that the earth should shrink. But our planet stays about the same size because new crust forms where plates move apart. Molten rock from the mantle wells up between them and sticks to the outer edges of the plates that are separating, in a process called sea-floor spreading.    Eruptions from a network of volcanic ridges along the bottom of the oceans also continually adds to the ocean floor.    An underwater mountain system in the Atlantic Ocean rises high enough in seven places to form groups of islands, including Iceland. These mountains (the Mid-Atlantic Ridge) are wedging North America and Europe farther apart, but at a snail's pace. The two continents have moved about 15 meters (50 ft) since Christopher Columbus arrived in the Americas in 1492.

Gradually, convection currents in the mantle beneath Pangaea tore the supercontinent apart. The separate land masses slowly evolved into the seven continents we know today. You can see roughly how the continents once fit together by looking at a map of the world. The pointed east side of South America seems to fit into the indented west side of Africa as neatly as two pieces of a puzzle. In fact, the fossil remains of Mesosaurus, a small reptile that lived 270 million years ago, are found only at the precise spots on the two continents where they fit together, and nowhere else in the world. Many formations such as mountain ranges and diamond mines also continue from one continent to the next, like separated puzzle pieces. Using the theory of plate tectonics, prospectors who find fossil fuels or mineral deposits on one continent may find similar deposits across the ocean on another continent.

The theory of plate tectonics, which provides insight into earth's geologic history, also may help predict the future. Scientists think that in 10 million years, Los Angeles, which is on the Pacific plate, will lie alongside San Francisco, which is on the North American plate. In 50 million years, Africa will probably be split in two. Its Great Rift Valley marks the boundary where two continental plates are pulling apart. The split will gash the face of Africa from the Red Sea to Mozambique.    And 200 million years from now, scientists predict that all the continents may come back together to form a new supercontinent.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25IMAGE PHOTOGRAPHTHE EVIDENCE IS OVERWHELMING that the Earths surface is warmer today than it was a century ago. As for why this is so, research by thousands of scientists strongly suggests that the cause is the largely uncontrolled and still increasing release of anthropogenic (human-caused) greenhouse gases. Yet there remain a few scientists who oppose these conclusions, claiming that either the evidence for significant global warming is unreliable or that, granting the problem, the sources are natural cycles over which we have little or no control.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25This isn't a mere academic debate. The conclusions held by leaders in a variety of fields can't help but have a profound impact on social, political, and economic policy. Thus each side has expended considerable effort to convince the public, and through it the political establishment, of the validity of its stance. But because neither has been entirely successful, particularly in the United States, policies have been inconsistent and changeable, subject to partisan wrangling, corporate lobbying, and a general inadequacy of resolve.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25The importance of the issue was most forcefully brought to the publics attention with Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita. Their unusual severity, being among the strongest ever recorded in the Gulf of Mexico, reminded a number of network newscasters of recent scientific reports predicting an increase in hurricane severity.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25For example, the article "Extreme Weather: Is Global Warming to Blame?" in the May/June 2005 E/The Environmental Magazine quoted Ruth Curry, a Woods Hole Oceanographie Institute research specialist, saying, "Sea surface temperatures all over the tropics are running 1.8 to 3.6 degrees above normal. This is due to global warming." The article's author, Jennifer Vogel, noted the relevance of this: "While ocean and atmospheric circulation is the engine of a hurricane, heat is the fuel." Her summation makes it all plain: "The general scientific consensus on climate change and hurricanes is this: Hurricanes won't necessarily become more frequent, but they will become more intense."

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25This view was further supported by Massachusetts Institute of Technology climatologist Kerry Emanuel, writing in the July 2005 issue of Nature. He reported research suggesting that violent storms originating in the Atlantic and Pacific since 1970 have increased in intensity and duration by approximately 50 percent.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25But on August 2 the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration raised its 2005 Atlantic Ocean hurricane forecast, predicting eighteen to twenty-one tropical storms: nine to eleven of which would become hurricanes and between five and seven expected to reach major hurricane status. By October 9 the season had already yielded twenty tropical storms, eleven of which became hurricanes and five that were major. By contrast, a typical Atlantic storm year has only six hurricanes with two to three being major. That this is part of a new trend over recent years emerges from the NOAA's statement that "these very high levels of activity are comparable to those seen during August-November 2003 and 2004." The conclusion would seem to be that, with global warming, hurricanes are becoming not only more severe but also more frequent. And the mainstream media is paying attention.

Toward that end, this article aims to assess that weight of evidence to see if it is, in fact, sufficiently alarming to recommend more than cosmetic action. It will also review the debate itself to see where the trouble lies and what the political dimensions of the problem have become.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25WHAT IS THE EVIDENCE THAT SIGNIFICANT GLOBAL WARMING IS OCCURRING?

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25If the summarized results of thousands of scientific studies that appear in the Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Control-Climate Change 2001, The Scientific Study, hereafter referred to as the IPCC 2001 report, are valid, the answer is unambiguously that significant global warming is occurring. Yet there are still a few dissenters in the scientific community, albeit a small minority. As a result, it will be necessary to examine the evidence and the arguments on both sides.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25Climate scientists define global warming as the measured increase in the mean Earth surface temperature over a specified time interval. The most reliable data are properly averaged over land and ocean surfaces, statistically weighted according to the density of measurements within each equal-area element. The final averaging is done for the entire surface of the globe.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25So, according to the IPCC 2001 report, the Earth's surface has warmed by approximately 0.6 degrees Centigrade over the twentieth century. That is approximately one degree Fahrenheit. The warming hasn't been uniform over the globe, however. In general it has been greater over the land than the oceans and, probably for that reason, greater over the northern hemisphere than the southern. This isn't surprising given the greater thermal inertia of the oceans due to the high heat capacity of water. There is also some speculation that the greater industrial activity, hence greater greenhouse gas emission, in the northern hemisphere may have contributed. However, because the main greenhouse gases are well mixed-staying in the circulating atmosphere for a long time-this effect may be small or even negligible.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25Of particular concern is the rapid temperature rise over the last quarter of the twentieth century. The observations reviewed in the IPCC 2001 report show that the 1990s was the hottest decade on record and the year 1998 the hottest year since reliable temperature measurements were made. Reliable direct temperature measurements carry the record back into the erature measurements carry the record back into the nineteenth century. And with the use of well-established indirect methods, it has been maintained that this decade was probably the hottest over the last thousand years.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25One might think this weight of evidence for global warming is so overwhelming that the only remaining issue would be to establish the cause. However, a few additional issues need to be examined. While none of these suggest that global warming in the twentieth century didn't occur, there is still some controversy over the details of the rise. The curve of increasing surface temperature in the twentieth century shows a definite increase in the first part of the century, then an extended plateau over the years 1940 to 1975, and finally the rapid increase already discussed. Scientists ask why there were thirty-five years of no significant measured temperature rise during a mid-century period of increasing emission of anthropogenic greenhouse gases. Though industrial aerosol emissions that could have balanced the effect of the greenhouse gases were also increasing during this period, no satisfactory answer has yet emerged.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25There is another problem that involves climate modeling. The best current general circulation models have predicted that tropospheric temperatures at heights in the atmosphere of a few kilometers should track surface temperatures. But measurements show little warming at these tropospheric levels, in disagreement with the models. Current work at the Goddard Institute for Space Science suggests that the discrepancy might be corrected by a better treatment of still poorly understood aerosols, plus dynamical processes that connect the troposphere with higher-lying atmospheric layers, but a definitive explanation hasn't yet emerged.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25This is why it's important to always keep in mind that final answers to many important questions relating to global warming don't yet exist. Science isn't a collection of proved certainties: a factor often used as a reason for doing practically nothing, as if any action taken before all questions have been definitively answered is premature. But if the weight of evidence suggests a problem is both real and likely to become more serious with time, most reasonable people would say that doing nothing is the height of folly. Therefore, notwithstanding the aforementioned uncertainties, there remains the fact that an enormous body of well-calibrated observations supports the unambiguous rise in global surface temperature.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25HOW SERIOUS ARE THE CONSEQUENCES OF GLOBAL WARMING?

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25Understanding the consensus of the scientific community, it remains necessary to ask if the likely harmful effects of global warming sufficiently outweigh the probable benefits of policies that might have harmful economic consequences. Furthermore, we need to ask about the likely positive effects of global warming? Might the news be good rather than bad?

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25There is some truth in this latter idea. Moderate global warming will enhance the agricultural productivity over parts of the globe. Climate models haven't advanced to the point of yielding accurate predictions of the detailed effects on all regional climates, but all of the more sophisticated models, in agreement with observations, predict that warming is greatest at the higher northern latitudes. Thus, for example, it seems probable that large areas of Russia and Canada could become more productive as the Earths surface warms, though this could be offset by insufficient regional rainfall, currently difficult to predict.

This has been confirmed experimentally in areas of new forest growth and annual agricultural production, which, because of the rapid growth rate of young plants, is more beneficial from the above standpoint than an old-growth forest where overall growth rates have greatly subsided.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25Perhaps most disturbing is sea-level rise. Water expands with increasing temperature, causing the sea level to rise accordingly. The best evidence from observations gives a mean global sea-level rise over the twentieth century of at least one foot, corresponding to the approximately one-degree Fahrenheit mean global temperature rise. Many of the world's glaciers are also retreating and very few are growing. If greater warming should induce significant melting of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (anchored in the ocean below sea level) or, worse, a significant part of the Greenland Ice Cap, the rise in sea level could exceed twenty feet or more. The effect on major coastal cities, if warming continues, is likely to become significant by the end of the twenty-first century and will be disastrous or even catastrophic if the warming exceeds moderate increases of a few degrees Fahrenheit.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25There will be many other damaging effects of sealevel rise. The global ocean-circulation "conveyor belt" is known to be highly sensitive to temperature and salinity, resulting in so-called thermohaline circulation. Some observations suggest that the Gulf Stream, on which northwestern Europe is critically dependent, may be slowing down due to the reduced density of Arctic seawater. This water is becoming fresher from the more rapid melting of the Arctic Ice Sheet and is thus less density driven to sink into the deep ocean, providing a major driving force for the circulation at high northern latitudes. Sea-level rise will also flood many coastal wetlands critical to certain human activities and many forms of wildlife. While tough-minded "realists" may scoff at the importance of songbirds in the United States, they need to consider the role these birds play in controlling insect pests. Flooding the low-lying swamps of southern Louisiana will ensure a precipitous drop in the numbers of insectivorous migrating songbirds that are critically dependent on this area for food after their long spring migration back to North America.

Warming increases the incidence of pathogens responsible for many human and animal diseases. Warming induces changes in weather patterns, with increasing evidence (as mentioned above) that we can expect more violent storms. Moreover, there has been a spate of recent, unusual weather extremes in Europe, from deadly heat waves (in which over 30,000 people died in 2003) to tumultuous rainstorms in southeastern Europe, to forest fires in Portugal, to drought throughout Iberia. And warming means that a smaller fraction of the Earths surface will be covered by snow and ice, which reflect sunlight more effectively than other land and sea surfaces. This increased absorption of sunlight sets in motion an unstable process that further enhances global warming.

For it is almost certain that the harmful effects will greatly outweigh the possible benefits, with many highly damaging effects already occurring.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25It is often noted by critics of the current consensus that many natural processes might contribute to global warming and that one or more of them may be the dominant driver or drivers. It is therefore necessary to look at this claim and see if it holds up.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25Examination of the mean global temperature curve for the northern hemisphere over the past millennium does reveal a fluctuating temperature of as much as 0.4 degrees Centigrade before the twentieth century. That is a sufficiently large fraction of the approximately 0.6 degree rise during the twentieth century to induce some scientists to speculate that even the recent rise, though unprecedented for the rate of change over this millennium, may have been caused by a long-period internal mode of the climate system, or by small longterm changes in the solar radiation.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25It is true that not all internal modes of the climate system are well understood. However, I am aware of no evidence for any mechanism of this kind that has been studied at length in the refereed literature and which appears likely to produce long-term global warming. Instead, this possibility remains an unsubstantiated if interesting speculation.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25This brings us to the sun, my primary area of expertise. A major effort has been underway in the National Aeronautic and Space Administration since 1979, and more recently in the European Space Agency, to obtain accurate measurements of the total solar irradiance (TSI), the flux of solar energy at the top of the Earth's atmosphere. One unambiguous result is that the TSI has varied by a small amount (no more than 0.1 percent) since 1979 over the well-known "eleven-year" solar cycle of sunspot activity. The TSI is measurably higher at solar maximum, when there are many sunspots, than at solar minimum, when there are few or none. However, this small increase in the solar flux, if simply "dumped" into the Earth's atmosphere as added heat, is insufficient to contribute to global warming. Furthermore, global warming doesn't exhibit a strong eleven-year cycle. Consequently, solar scientists have also looked for a change in the TSI over times longer than one eleven-year cycle. A recent increase should show up in the TSI measured at successive solar minima, when solar-cycle dependent processes that contribute to the TSI are largely absent. Unfortunately, the precision of the observations to date hasn't yielded a definitive result, though what evidence is available suggests there is either no change between minima or a very small change that, viewed as heat introduced into the Earths atmosphere, by itself couldn't explain the recent mean global temperature rise.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25One must note that there are further possibilities for solar influence involving the effect of solar ultraviolet radiation on our upper atmosphere, and also possible small long-term changes in the solar interplanetary magnetic field at Earth, which influences comic-ray penetration and could indirectly affect cloud formation. These are subjects of ongoing research. Notwithstanding these many efforts, no strong suggestion has emerged that any of the known solar influences are playing a major role as global warming drivers.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25The lack of a convincing argument based on solid research for any of the above hypotheses leads us to ask what we humans are doing that may be causing global warming. This leads naturally into an examination of anthropogenic greenhouse gases. Unlike the more speculative discussion of possible causes reviewed above, a very strong case can be made that carbon dioxide, in particular, is probably a significant driver, and could well be the dominant driver, of the current rapid rise in global mean surface temperatures.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25There is no disagreement over the occurrence of the greenhouse effect to which carbon dioxide contributes. If the relatively long-wavelength infrared radiation from the relatively cool (compared to the sun's emitting surface) Earth all escaped into space, the Earth would be approximately fifty degrees Fahrenheit cooler than it is. Therefore life as we know it is critically dependent on the greenhouse effect. The question becomes how much greenhouse effect is good for us. Carbon dioxide is a well-studied gas that readily absorbs Earth's infrared radiation and reradiates part of it back to the Earth, thus causing warming. We know that the concentration of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere has increased by more than 30 percent since the beginning of the industrial revolution and that this percentage is increasing rapidly today, especially as China and India industrialize. We also know that carbon dioxide is so well mixed in our atmosphere that once there it will remain for more than a century unless we actively remove it. Thus, to stabilize the concentration of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere and prevent ever more efficient greenhouse warming, we will need to reduce the emission of carbon dioxide well below current rates of production-unless some powerful new "sink" for removing the gas can be developed. Even doing that won't likely lead to a stable situation for several decades; this is because of the aforementioned mixing problem. Finally, the more carbon dioxide we put into the atmosphere, the more the water in this warmed-up atmosphere will appear in vapor form; and water vapor is the most effective greenhouse gas of all.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25Taken together, one quickly sees why all quantitative estimates of the most effective driver of global warming reported in the IPCC 2001 report identify carbon dioxide as the strongest contributor. To summarize, the extensively studied and well-known greenhouse effects of carbon dioxide are so strong that, combined with its persistence in our atmosphere, we can reasonably conclude that the increasing atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide from human activity is very likely the dominant driver of global warming, and the warming effects will probably become worse with time for several decades, even after the emission rate has subsided.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25There are other greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming. Methane is the most important of these, but nitrous oxides also contribute and their concentration is rapidly increasing. All these gases are well mixed and will remain in the atmosphere for many decades. Aerosols also play an important role in global warming, and the effect of most of them, especially the sulphates, is generally toward cooling, as we have learned from the effect of large volcanic eruptions. However, based on the best knowledge available today from a large scientific community, the net effect of all of the other contributors to global warming isn't comparable to the effect of the well-studied greenhouse gases, with anthropogenic carbon dioxide demonstrably the leading contributor.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25Any consideration of the political dimension of an issue that has the global character of this one demands that we grasp the extraordinary complexity of the political challenge. There is seldom an easy path to effective action, even if the arguments favoring it are compelling. There will usually be those passionately devoted to the opposite viewpoint, even if the real source of their position is to maintain the status quo. These opponents are often articulate, and some of them hold positions of great influence. That is one problem faced by those who would take decisive action to address global warming today.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25But there is another. As Paul Krugman reports in the August 5 issue of the New York Times, there exists "a sort of parallel intellectual universe" in the sciences. Back in 1978, neoconservative theorist Irving Kristol encouraged major corporations to direct their "philanthropic contributions to scholars and institutions who are likely to advocate preservation of a strong private sector." Thus conservative think tanks emerged, first in the area of economics and then in hard science-creating in Krugman's words, "a world of 'scholars' whose careers are based on toeing an ideological line, rather than on doing research that stands up to scrutiny by their peers." We see this clearly regarding the issue of global warming. Even though the scientific consensus is overwhelming, skeptical reports having the appearance of peerreviewed research have led large segments of the public, as well as national leaders, to believe that global warming is a controversial idea.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25I attended a presentation on the question of global warming at the Rayburn House Office Building in Washington, DC, in May 2002, shortly after the IPCC 2001 report became generally available. A booklet was passed out by its author, Dr. S. Fred Singer, bearing the title The Kyoto Protocol is Not Backed by Science. This booklet makes frequent reference to the IPCC 2001 report, which contains a graph of surface temperature versus time up to the year 2000 C.E. The booklet carries a similar temperature-time plot on page 30, but cuts it off in the 1980s, just before the most spectacular rise in the 1990s! In the caption to this latter plot it says:

Temperatures fell till about 1975, when there was a sudden jump, tied to changes in ocean circulation and other worldwide changes.

Until backed by serious research, such claims are unconfirmed speculations.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25One more feature of the booklet is worth noting. In a paragraph on page 10, which argues that temperature observations since 1979 are in dispute, there appears the sentence, "It is likely therefore that the surface data (from poorly distributed land stations and sparse ocean measurements) are contaminated by the local warming effects of 'urban heat islands' acting on weather station thermometers (HTCS, 13)" The HTCS is a book by the same author, not a refereed scientific paper. And if the most recent temperature measurements had been so badly compromised-a conclusion with which many distinguished observers would stoutly disagree-those made at earlier dates to which I refer for comparisons were certainly much worse. Most significant of all, the IPPC 2001 report, on page 106, carries the following summary of many scientists who have studied the urban heat island effect in detail and whose work appears in the refereed literature.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25Clearly the urban heat island effect is a real climate change in urban areas, but is not representative of larger areas. Extensive tests have shown that the urban heat island effects are no more than about 0.05 degrees Centigrade up to 1990 in the global temperature records used in this chapter to depict climate change.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25The reader is encouraged to compare the above two direct quotes. Hopefully policy makers will compare the things they are told in science-policy briefings with the published consensus of working scientists. There are, after all, good reasons why almost all scientists are convinced that the evidence strongly supports the position that significant global warming is occurring, that the recently measured rate of global surface temperature rise is cause for serious concern, and that anthropogenic greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide, are likely the chief drivers of the current disturbing mean global temperature rise.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25This leaves us with the challenge of finding some politically practicable way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But it is an awkward truth that when most U.S. senators were asked informally in 2000 if they would support the Kyoto Protocol should President George W. Bush send it to the Senate for ratification, the overwhelming majority, Democrats as well as Republicans, said they could not. (Since that time, some new terms have been included in the Protocol to facilitate the admission of China and India, so this situation may have changed.) The reason for the liberals' surprising reply is clear. Many studies, not all by conservatives, suggest that full compliance with the terms of the Kyoto Protocol would likely lead to a deep American recession. For those willing to run this risk, sober reflection on the consequences of the economic collapse of 1929 and the subsequent worldwide depression with all its political and ultimately military consequences is certainly in order.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25That said, what can be done, in particular by our own country? I have no new ideas for the solution, nor have I to date discovered any valid ones proposed by others. Nevertheless, in agreement with a large number of scientists who have given this issue considerable thought, there is one unambiguous statement I would make. Independent of the issues raised by the Kyoto Protocol, and given the weight of evidence that the problem of global warming is serious and fraught with dire consequences, failure to do anything at all and instead to promote "business as usual" is downright criminal.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25Yet I see little evidence that the Bush administration has given more than lip service to the problem, though that could be changing. It is one thing to weigh alternatives and implement compromises that reflect the complexity of the problem; it is quite another thing to do nothing, especially if doing nothing is just a way of securing support from certain industries that exacerbate the problem.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25There are, after all, things that can be done. Reopening a serious international dialogue, and not just saying a few good words, would be a useful if inadequate start. Not every problem must be solved before the weight of evidence becomes so compelling that certain initial steps become almost mandatory. We already know how to make more fuel-efficient automobiles, yet no national policy has surfaced to accomplish this. The scientific and engineering communities are the ones best suited to identify the scientific research that is still needed and the technical projects that show the greatest promise. These issues should be decided by them and not the politicians. Once solutions look promising, as a few already do, industry will be all too ready to jump in, for at that stage there is money to be made. And only a fool would underestimate human ingenuity when given a proper incentive, or the strength of American industry once the boiler is lit under it.

As for why this is so, research by thousands of scientists strongly suggests that the cause is the largely uncontrolled and still increasing release of anthropogenic (human-caused) greenhouse gases. Yet there remain a few scientists who oppose these conclusions, claiming that either the evidence for significant global warming is unreliable or that, granting the problem, the sources are natural cycles over which we have little or no control.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25This isn't a mere academic debate. The conclusions held by leaders in a variety of fields can't help but have a profound impact on social, political, and economic policy. Thus each side has expended considerable effort to convince the public, and through it the political establishment, of the validity of its stance. But because neither has been entirely successful, particularly in the United States, policies have been inconsistent and changeable, subject to partisan wrangling, corporate lobbying, and a general inadequacy of resolve.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25The importance of the issue was most forcefully brought to the publics attention with Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita. Their unusual severity, being among the strongest ever recorded in the Gulf of Mexico, reminded a number of network newscasters of recent scientific reports predicting an increase in hurricane severity.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25For example, the article "Extreme Weather: Is Global Warming to Blame?" in the May/June 2005 E/The Environmental Magazine quoted Ruth Curry, a Woods Hole Oceanographie Institute research specialist, saying, "Sea surface temperatures all over the tropics are running 1.8 to 3.6 degrees above normal. This is due to global warming." The article's author, Jennifer Vogel, noted the relevance of this: "While ocean and atmospheric circulation is the engine of a hurricane, heat is the fuel." Her summation makes it all plain: "The general scientific consensus on climate change and hurricanes is this: Hurricanes won't necessarily become more frequent, but they will become more intense."

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25This view was further supported by Massachusetts Institute of Technology climatologist Kerry Emanuel, writing in the July 2005 issue of Nature. He reported research suggesting that violent storms originating in the Atlantic and Pacific since 1970 have increased in intensity and duration by approximately 50 percent.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25But on August 2 the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration raised its 2005 Atlantic Ocean hurricane forecast, predicting eighteen to twenty-one tropical storms: nine to eleven of which would become hurricanes and between five and seven expected to reach major hurricane status. By October 9 the season had already yielded twenty tropical storms, eleven of which became hurricanes and five that were major. By contrast, a typical Atlantic storm year has only six hurricanes with two to three being major. That this is part of a new trend over recent years emerges from the NOAA's statement that "these very high levels of activity are comparable to those seen during August-November 2003 and 2004." The conclusion would seem to be that, with global warming, hurricanes are becoming not only more severe but also more frequent. And the mainstream media is paying attention.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25If the summarized results of thousands of scientific studies that appear in the Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Control-Climate Change 2001, The Scientific Study, hereafter referred to as the IPCC 2001 report, are valid, the answer is unambiguously that significant global warming is occurring. Yet there are still a few dissenters in the scientific community, albeit a small minority. As a result, it will be necessary to examine the evidence and the arguments on both sides.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25Climate scientists define global warming as the measured increase in the mean Earth surface temperature over a specified time interval. The most reliable data are properly averaged over land and ocean surfaces, statistically weighted according to the density of measurements within each equal-area element. The final averaging is done for the entire surface of the globe.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25So, according to the IPCC 2001 report, the Earth's surface has warmed by approximately 0.6 degrees Centigrade over the twentieth century. That is approximately one degree Fahrenheit. The warming hasn't been uniform over the globe, however. In general it has been greater over the land than the oceans and, probably for that reason, greater over the northern hemisphere than the southern. This isn't surprising given the greater thermal inertia of the oceans due to the high heat capacity of water. There is also some speculation that the greater industrial activity, hence greater greenhouse gas emission, in the northern hemisphere may have contributed. However, because the main greenhouse gases are well mixed-staying in the circulating atmosphere for a long time-this effect may be small or even negligible.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25Of particular concern is the rapid temperature rise over the last quarter of the twentieth century. The observations reviewed in the IPCC 2001 report show that the 1990s was the hottest decade on record and the year 1998 the hottest year since reliable temperature measurements were made. Reliable direct temperature measurements carry the record back into the erature measurements carry the record back into the nineteenth century. And with the use of well-established indirect methods, it has been maintained that this decade was probably the hottest over the last thousand years.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25One might think this weight of evidence for global warming is so overwhelming that the only remaining issue would be to establish the cause. However, a few additional issues need to be examined. While none of these suggest that global warming in the twentieth century didn't occur, there is still some controversy over the details of the rise. The curve of increasing surface temperature in the twentieth century shows a definite increase in the first part of the century, then an extended plateau over the years 1940 to 1975, and finally the rapid increase already discussed. Scientists ask why there were thirty-five years of no significant measured temperature rise during a mid-century period of increasing emission of anthropogenic greenhouse gases. Though industrial aerosol emissions that could have balanced the effect of the greenhouse gases were also increasing during this period, no satisfactory answer has yet emerged.

The best current general circulation models have predicted that tropospheric temperatures at heights in the atmosphere of a few kilometers should track surface temperatures. But measurements show little warming at these tropospheric levels, in disagreement with the models. Current work at the Goddard Institute for Space Science suggests that the discrepancy might be corrected by a better treatment of still poorly understood aerosols, plus dynamical processes that connect the troposphere with higher-lying atmospheric layers, but a definitive explanation hasn't yet emerged.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25This is why it's important to always keep in mind that final answers to many important questions relating to global warming don't yet exist. Science isn't a collection of proved certainties: a factor often used as a reason for doing practically nothing, as if any action taken before all questions have been definitively answered is premature. But if the weight of evidence suggests a problem is both real and likely to become more serious with time, most reasonable people would say that doing nothing is the height of folly. Therefore, notwithstanding the aforementioned uncertainties, there remains the fact that an enormous body of well-calibrated observations supports the unambiguous rise in global surface temperature.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25Understanding the consensus of the scientific community, it remains necessary to ask if the likely harmful effects of global warming sufficiently outweigh the probable benefits of policies that might have harmful economic consequences. Furthermore, we need to ask about the likely positive effects of global warming? Might the news be good rather than bad?

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25There is some truth in this latter idea. Moderate global warming will enhance the agricultural productivity over parts of the globe. Climate models haven't advanced to the point of yielding accurate predictions of the detailed effects on all regional climates, but all of the more sophisticated models, in agreement with observations, predict that warming is greatest at the higher northern latitudes. Thus, for example, it seems probable that large areas of Russia and Canada could become more productive as the Earths surface warms, though this could be offset by insufficient regional rainfall, currently difficult to predict.

This has been confirmed experimentally in areas of new forest growth and annual agricultural production, which, because of the rapid growth rate of young plants, is more beneficial from the above standpoint than an old-growth forest where overall growth rates have greatly subsided.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25But are these benefits likely to significantly offset the known harmful effects of global warming? Let's review the negative consequences.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25Perhaps most disturbing is sea-level rise. Water expands with increasing temperature, causing the sea level to rise accordingly. The best evidence from observations gives a mean global sea-level rise over the twentieth century of at least one foot, corresponding to the approximately one-degree Fahrenheit mean global temperature rise. Many of the world's glaciers are also retreating and very few are growing. If greater warming should induce significant melting of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (anchored in the ocean below sea level) or, worse, a significant part of the Greenland Ice Cap, the rise in sea level could exceed twenty feet or more. The effect on major coastal cities, if warming continues, is likely to become significant by the end of the twenty-first century and will be disastrous or even catastrophic if the warming exceeds moderate increases of a few degrees Fahrenheit.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25There will be many other damaging effects of sealevel rise. The global ocean-circulation "conveyor belt" is known to be highly sensitive to temperature and salinity, resulting in so-called thermohaline circulation. Some observations suggest that the Gulf Stream, on which northwestern Europe is critically dependent, may be slowing down due to the reduced density of Arctic seawater. This water is becoming fresher from the more rapid melting of the Arctic Ice Sheet and is thus less density driven to sink into the deep ocean, providing a major driving force for the circulation at high northern latitudes. Sea-level rise will also flood many coastal wetlands critical to certain human activities and many forms of wildlife. While tough-minded "realists" may scoff at the importance of songbirds in the United States, they need to consider the role these birds play in controlling insect pests. Flooding the low-lying swamps of southern Louisiana will ensure a precipitous drop in the numbers of insectivorous migrating songbirds that are critically dependent on this area for food after their long spring migration back to North America.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25Many other damaging effects of global warming are known with near certainty. Warming increases the incidence of pathogens responsible for many human and animal diseases. Warming induces changes in weather patterns, with increasing evidence (as mentioned above) that we can expect more violent storms. Moreover, there has been a spate of recent, unusual weather extremes in Europe, from deadly heat waves (in which over 30,000 people died in 2003) to tumultuous rainstorms in southeastern Europe, to forest fires in Portugal, to drought throughout Iberia. And warming means that a smaller fraction of the Earths surface will be covered by snow and ice, which reflect sunlight more effectively than other land and sea surfaces. This increased absorption of sunlight sets in motion an unstable process that further enhances global warming.

For it is almost certain that the harmful effects will greatly outweigh the possible benefits, with many highly damaging effects already occurring.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25It is often noted by critics of the current consensus that many natural processes might contribute to global warming and that one or more of them may be the dominant driver or drivers. It is therefore necessary to look at this claim and see if it holds up.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25Examination of the mean global temperature curve for the northern hemisphere over the past millennium does reveal a fluctuating temperature of as much as 0.4 degrees Centigrade before the twentieth century. That is a sufficiently large fraction of the approximately 0.6 degree rise during the twentieth century to induce some scientists to speculate that even the recent rise, though unprecedented for the rate of change over this millennium, may have been caused by a long-period internal mode of the climate system, or by small longterm changes in the solar radiation.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25It is true that not all internal modes of the climate system are well understood. However, I am aware of no evidence for any mechanism of this kind that has been studied at length in the refereed literature and which appears likely to produce long-term global warming. Instead, this possibility remains an unsubstantiated if interesting speculation.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25This brings us to the sun, my primary area of expertise. A major effort has been underway in the National Aeronautic and Space Administration since 1979, and more recently in the European Space Agency, to obtain accurate measurements of the total solar irradiance (TSI), the flux of solar energy at the top of the Earth's atmosphere. One unambiguous result is that the TSI has varied by a small amount (no more than 0.1 percent) since 1979 over the well-known "eleven-year" solar cycle of sunspot activity. The TSI is measurably higher at solar maximum, when there are many sunspots, than at solar minimum, when there are few or none. However, this small increase in the solar flux, if simply "dumped" into the Earth's atmosphere as added heat, is insufficient to contribute to global warming. Furthermore, global warming doesn't exhibit a strong eleven-year cycle. Consequently, solar scientists have also looked for a change in the TSI over times longer than one eleven-year cycle. A recent increase should show up in the TSI measured at successive solar minima, when solar-cycle dependent processes that contribute to the TSI are largely absent. Unfortunately, the precision of the observations to date hasn't yielded a definitive result, though what evidence is available suggests there is either no change between minima or a very small change that, viewed as heat introduced into the Earths atmosphere, by itself couldn't explain the recent mean global temperature rise.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25One must note that there are further possibilities for solar influence involving the effect of solar ultraviolet radiation on our upper atmosphere, and also possible small long-term changes in the solar interplanetary magnetic field at Earth, which influences comic-ray penetration and could indirectly affect cloud formation. These are subjects of ongoing research. Notwithstanding these many efforts, no strong suggestion has emerged that any of the known solar influences are playing a major role as global warming drivers.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25The lack of a convincing argument based on solid research for any of the above hypotheses leads us to ask what we humans are doing that may be causing global warming. This leads naturally into an examination of anthropogenic greenhouse gases. Unlike the more speculative discussion of possible causes reviewed above, a very strong case can be made that carbon dioxide, in particular, is probably a significant driver, and could well be the dominant driver, of the current rapid rise in global mean surface temperatures.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25There is no disagreement over the occurrence of the greenhouse effect to which carbon dioxide contributes. If the relatively long-wavelength infrared radiation from the relatively cool (compared to the sun's emitting surface) Earth all escaped into space, the Earth would be approximately fifty degrees Fahrenheit cooler than it is. Therefore life as we know it is critically dependent on the greenhouse effect. The question becomes how much greenhouse effect is good for us. Carbon dioxide is a well-studied gas that readily absorbs Earth's infrared radiation and reradiates part of it back to the Earth, thus causing warming. We know that the concentration of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere has increased by more than 30 percent since the beginning of the industrial revolution and that this percentage is increasing rapidly today, especially as China and India industrialize. We also know that carbon dioxide is so well mixed in our atmosphere that once there it will remain for more than a century unless we actively remove it. Thus, to stabilize the concentration of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere and prevent ever more efficient greenhouse warming, we will need to reduce the emission of carbon dioxide well below current rates of production-unless some powerful new "sink" for removing the gas can be developed. Even doing that won't likely lead to a stable situation for several decades; this is because of the aforementioned mixing problem. Finally, the more carbon dioxide we put into the atmosphere, the more the water in this warmed-up atmosphere will appear in vapor form; and water vapor is the most effective greenhouse gas of all.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25Taken together, one quickly sees why all quantitative estimates of the most effective driver of global warming reported in the IPCC 2001 report identify carbon dioxide as the strongest contributor. To summarize, the extensively studied and well-known greenhouse effects of carbon dioxide are so strong that, combined with its persistence in our atmosphere, we can reasonably conclude that the increasing atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide from human activity is very likely the dominant driver of global warming, and the warming effects will probably become worse with time for several decades, even after the emission rate has subsided.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25There are other greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming. Methane is the most important of these, but nitrous oxides also contribute and their concentration is rapidly increasing. All these gases are well mixed and will remain in the atmosphere for many decades. Aerosols also play an important role in global warming, and the effect of most of them, especially the sulphates, is generally toward cooling, as we have learned from the effect of large volcanic eruptions. However, based on the best knowledge available today from a large scientific community, the net effect of all of the other contributors to global warming isn't comparable to the effect of the well-studied greenhouse gases, with anthropogenic carbon dioxide demonstrably the leading contributor.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25Any consideration of the political dimension of an issue that has the global character of this one demands that we grasp the extraordinary complexity of the political challenge. There is seldom an easy path to effective action, even if the arguments favoring it are compelling. There will usually be those passionately devoted to the opposite viewpoint, even if the real source of their position is to maintain the status quo. These opponents are often articulate, and some of them hold positions of great influence. That is one problem faced by those who would take decisive action to address global warming today.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25But there is another. As Paul Krugman reports in the August 5 issue of the New York Times, there exists "a sort of parallel intellectual universe" in the sciences. Back in 1978, neoconservative theorist Irving Kristol encouraged major corporations to direct their "philanthropic contributions to scholars and institutions who are likely to advocate preservation of a strong private sector." Thus conservative think tanks emerged, first in the area of economics and then in hard science-creating in Krugman's words, "a world of 'scholars' whose careers are based on toeing an ideological line, rather than on doing research that stands up to scrutiny by their peers." We see this clearly regarding the issue of global warming. Even though the scientific consensus is overwhelming, skeptical reports having the appearance of peerreviewed research have led large segments of the public, as well as national leaders, to believe that global warming is a controversial idea.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25I attended a presentation on the question of global warming at the Rayburn House Office Building in Washington, DC, in May 2002, shortly after the IPCC 2001 report became generally available. A booklet was passed out by its author, Dr. S. Fred Singer, bearing the title The Kyoto Protocol is Not Backed by Science. This booklet makes frequent reference to the IPCC 2001 report, which contains a graph of surface temperature versus time up to the year 2000 C.E. The booklet carries a similar temperature-time plot on page 30, but cuts it off in the 1980s, just before the most spectacular rise in the 1990s! In the caption to this latter plot it says:

Temperatures fell till about 1975, when there was a sudden jump, tied to changes in ocean circulation and other worldwide changes.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25I am unaware of any refereed scientific paper that would make such sweeping categorical statements on effects spanning a millennium. Until backed by serious research, such claims are unconfirmed speculations.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25One more feature of the booklet is worth noting. In a paragraph on page 10, which argues that temperature observations since 1979 are in dispute, there appears the sentence, "It is likely therefore that the surface data (from poorly distributed land stations and sparse ocean measurements) are contaminated by the local warming effects of 'urban heat islands' acting on weather station thermometers (HTCS, 13)" The HTCS is a book by the same author, not a refereed scientific paper. And if the most recent temperature measurements had been so badly compromised-a conclusion with which many distinguished observers would stoutly disagree-those made at earlier dates to which I refer for comparisons were certainly much worse. Most significant of all, the IPPC 2001 report, on page 106, carries the following summary of many scientists who have studied the urban heat island effect in detail and whose work appears in the refereed literature.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25Clearly the urban heat island effect is a real climate change in urban areas, but is not representative of larger areas. Extensive tests have shown that the urban heat island effects are no more than about 0.05 degrees Centigrade up to 1990 in the global temperature records used in this chapter to depict climate change.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25The reader is encouraged to compare the above two direct quotes. Hopefully policy makers will compare the things they are told in science-policy briefings with the published consensus of working scientists. There are, after all, good reasons why almost all scientists are convinced that the evidence strongly supports the position that significant global warming is occurring, that the recently measured rate of global surface temperature rise is cause for serious concern, and that anthropogenic greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide, are likely the chief drivers of the current disturbing mean global temperature rise.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25This leaves us with the challenge of finding some politically practicable way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But it is an awkward truth that when most U.S. senators were asked informally in 2000 if they would support the Kyoto Protocol should President George W. Bush send it to the Senate for ratification, the overwhelming majority, Democrats as well as Republicans, said they could not. (Since that time, some new terms have been included in the Protocol to facilitate the admission of China and India, so this situation may have changed.) The reason for the liberals' surprising reply is clear. Many studies, not all by conservatives, suggest that full compliance with the terms of the Kyoto Protocol would likely lead to a deep American recession. For those willing to run this risk, sober reflection on the consequences of the economic collapse of 1929 and the subsequent worldwide depression with all its political and ultimately military consequences is certainly in order.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25That said, what can be done, in particular by our own country? I have no new ideas for the solution, nor have I to date discovered any valid ones proposed by others. Nevertheless, in agreement with a large number of scientists who have given this issue considerable thought, there is one unambiguous statement I would make. Independent of the issues raised by the Kyoto Protocol, and given the weight of evidence that the problem of global warming is serious and fraught with dire consequences, failure to do anything at all and instead to promote "business as usual" is downright criminal.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25Yet I see little evidence that the Bush administration has given more than lip service to the problem, though that could be changing. It is one thing to weigh alternatives and implement compromises that reflect the complexity of the problem; it is quite another thing to do nothing, especially if doing nothing is just a way of securing support from certain industries that exacerbate the problem.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25There are, after all, things that can be done. Reopening a serious international dialogue, and not just saying a few good words, would be a useful if inadequate start. Not every problem must be solved before the weight of evidence becomes so compelling that certain initial steps become almost mandatory. We already know how to make more fuel-efficient automobiles, yet no national policy has surfaced to accomplish this. The scientific and engineering communities are the ones best suited to identify the scientific research that is still needed and the technical projects that show the greatest promise. These issues should be decided by them and not the politicians. Once solutions look promising, as a few already do, industry will be all too ready to jump in, for at that stage there is money to be made. And only a fool would underestimate human ingenuity when given a proper incentive, or the strength of American industry once the boiler is lit under it.

It represents a transformation in psychiatric thinking. Psychiatrists are diagnosing more and more of the population as "depressed," by which they primarily mean the medical condition of major depressive disorder. Psychiatric epidemiological studies indicate that depression now afflicts about 10 percent of adults in the United States each year and about a quarter of the population at some point in their lives. This number has been steadily growing, they say: For the past several decades, each successive generation has reported more depressive disorders than the previous one. These enormous numbers have mobilized psychiatry, general medical practice, and the psychopharmacology industry to mount a coordinated (and profitable) offensive. Today, better recognition of unreported, hidden, or "sub-clinical" depression (that is, depression exhibiting fewer than the number of symptoms usually required for diagnosis) pushes prevalence numbers ever higher.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25Not only the number of people said to be depressed but also the number actually treated has increased greatly in recent years. The percentage of the overall population in mental-health treatment for "mood disorders," the category of psychiatric disorder that includes major depression and related conditions, has nearly doubled since the early 1980s. Moreover, in 1997, fully 40 percent of all psychotherapy patients were diagnosed with some mood disorder, compared to 20 percent in 1987. Three times more people were treated for depression in primary medical care in 1997 than ten years earlier. The consumption of antidepressant medications both in absolute numbers and in percentage of diagnosed patients receiving medication has also dramatically expanded; persons treated for depression were four and one-half times more likely to receive psychotropic medication in 1997 than in 1987. At present, three of the seven highest-selling prescription drugs (Prozac, Paxil, and Zoloft) of any sort are antidepressants. W. H. Auden's "Age of Anxiety" appears to have been succeeded by our own "Age of Depressive Disorder."

It is the idea that contemporary race relations tend to be viewed only through the prism of the historical relationship between African Americans and Americans of European descent.

Younger Americans, for instance, fail to realize that many of today's African American institutions didn't exist before the 1950s. Another example is members of the media who refer to "the black community," when they really mean only the poorest African Americans.

Exercise intolerance may result from ventilatory limitation, cardiovascular impairment, and/or skeletal muscle dysfunction. Exercise training, a core component of pulmonary rehabilitation, improves the exercise capacity (endurance and, to a lesser degree, maximal work capacity) of patients with COPD in spite of the irreversible abnormalities in lung function. Dyspnea and health-related quality of life also improve following pulmonary rehabilitation. The clinical benefits of exercise rehabilitation last up to 2 years following 8 to 12 weeks of training. Existing evidence-based guidelines recommend that exercise training/pulmonary rehabilitation be included routinely in the management of patients with moderate to severe COPD. Exercise training/pulmonary rehabilitation may be undertaken in an inpatient, outpatient, or home-based setting, depending on the individual needs of the patient and available resources. The type and intensity of training and muscle groups trained determine the expected outcomes of exercise training. Both high- and low-intensity exercise lead to increased exercise endurance, but only high-intensity training also leads to physiologic gains in aerobic fitness. The rationale for and outcomes of lower- and upper-limb training, as well as ventilatory muscle training, are reviewed, and the potential for anabolic hormone supplementation to optimize the benefits of exercise training is discussed.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major cause of morbidity, mortality, and health care use [1]. Exercise intolerance is one of the most troubling manifestations of COPD. Persons with mild stages of the disease may experience dyspnea during heavy exertion that is attributed to "slowing down with age." Patients with moderate and severe COPD commonly have difficulty performing such normal daily tasks as work, recreational exercise, hobbies, and self-care. Dyspnea, leg fatigue, and discomfort are the principal symptoms that limit exercise [2], and patients typically limit their activities to avoid these uncomfortable sensations. The resultant inactivity leads to progressive deconditioning that further increases the sense of respiratory effort related to any given task. Ultimately, patients often become progressively homebound and isolated, and may develop worsening depression and anxiety. Such depression is associated with significant disturbances in physical function [3]. Indeed, exercise capacity and health status also correlate with mortality [4].

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25Several coexisting factors contribute to exercise intolerance in COPD [5-8]. Importantly, however, it is possible to improve the exercise tolerance of the COPD patient, despite permanent impairment of lung function. Optimization of medical therapy, use of breathing strategies such as pursed-lips breathing and oxygen therapy (for hypoxemic persons) [9], anxiety management, slow deep breathing, and nutritional intervention [10] can all be beneficial. Exercise training, the focus of this review, has been proven conclusively to improve exercise tolerance for patients with COPD over and above gains made by optimizing medical therapy. It must be noted that many clinical trials demonstrating the benefits of exercise training have been undertaken in the context of comprehensive pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) programs. Although exercise training is the crucial core process in PR, the benefits of training noted in these trials cannot be viewed as separate from those derived from other important interventions included in PR, such as patient and family education, training with pacing, energy conservation and breathing techniques, anxiety and dyspnea management, reinforcement of cigarette abstinence, optimization of oxygen therapy, medical management, and nutrition. These additional processes aimed at long-term lifestyle modification likely enhance and maximize the benefits of exercise training [11,12]. As such, when possible, exercise training for patients with COPD optimally should be pursued initially in the setting of a formal PR program, in hopes that the helpful strategies learned will be continued long-term.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25While the current clinical guidelines for PR for patients with chronic respiratory disease are referenced in this review, this article does not represent a new set of guidelines. Moreover, whereas the existing published guidelines for PR address some benefits of and recommendations for exercise training, they also provide a review of the behavioral, educational, and psychosocial aspects of PR and the outcomes tools used to measure exercise and other benefits derived from PR. In contrast, this manuscript provides an up-to-date, evidence-based review specifically focusing on the scientific rationale for and benefits of exercise training for patients with COPD. The multifaceted scientific basis of exercise intolerance in COPD is presented. Patient candidacy and clinical outcomes of exercise training for these patients are reviewed. Also, the rationale for selected approaches (type and intensity) of lower- and upper-limb and ventilatory muscle training are considered, based on existing medical literature. Finally, the use of anabolic hormone supplementation to optimize the benefits of exercise training is discussed.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25First, ventilatory limitation occurs for several reasons [5,13]. Increased airways resistance and expiratory flow limitation increase the work of breathing. Severe airflow obstruction can also lead to impaired lung emptying and higher end-expiratory lung volume that worsens during exercise (dynamic hyperinflation), as well as during hyperpnea of any other cause (e.g., anxiety). This hyperinflation limits the tidal volume (Vt) response to exercise [14], increases the elastic load to the inspiratory muscles, and leads to mechanical disadvantage of the respiratory muscles by forcing them into a shortened position (where the muscle length-tension relationship is altered). Indeed, the degree of hyperinflation is an important predictor of exercise capacity and dyspnea during exercise. The respiratory muscles may be further limited in their ability to generate inspiratory pressure by electrolyte disturbances, steroid myopathy, or loss of muscle mass due to impaired nutrition [15-17]. Ventilatory limitation to exercise also occurs as a result of gas exchange abnormalities that arise from excess physiologic dead space (dead space to tidal volume ratio, Vd/Vt), ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) mismatch, and reduction in diffusing capacity. Increased Vd/Vt leads to increased ventilatory demand for a comparable degree of work. Early onset lactic acidosis and other factors, such as hypoxemia, further exaggerate the increased ventilatory demand [13,18].

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25Coexisting cardiovascular limitation to exercise is common. In particular, increases in pulmonary vascular resistance (due to hypoxic vasoconstriction and/or structural abnormality of the pulmonary vasculature) and decreased right ventricular (RV) preload related to hyper-inflation commonly lead to RV stroke volume limitation that impedes exercise capacity by limiting cardiac output [14,19].

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25Skeletal muscle dysfunction is another major factor that can contribute to exercise intolerance [18,20]. This is evidenced by the findings that (1) forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV^sub 1^) alone is a relatively poor correlate of exercise tolerance, (2) the perception of leg effort or discomfort is the main symptom that limits exercise in 40 to 45 percent of patients with COPD, and (3) exercise intolerance often persists after lung transplantation, when the patient's ventilatory limitation has been eliminated [18]. Nutritional (related to loss of muscle mass and/or obesity) and psychological factors such as anxiety also frequently impact exercise performance.

Skeletal muscle dysfunction in COPD is characterized by reductions in muscle mass and strength [21,22], atrophy of type I (slow twitch, oxidative, endurance) [23,24] and type IIa (fast-twitch, glycolytic) muscle fibers [25], reduction in fiber capillarization [26] and oxidative enzyme capacity [27-29], and reduced muscle endurance [20,30,31]. Both resting and exercise muscle metabolism are impaired [20,28,32,33], and patients develop lactic acidosis at lower exercise work loads than healthy persons [16,18]. This leads to an increased ventilatory requirement and early onset of muscle fatigue. The impaired skeletal muscle mass and strength in COPD is associated with reduced exercise capacity [34,35], and increased use of health care resources [36]. Importantly, low muscle mass is also a strong predictor of mortality in COPD [37-39], independent of the degree of lung function impairment. Moreover, improvements in muscle mass have been associated with improved survival [37].

Available data suggest that systemic inflammation, low anabolic hormone levels, reactive oxygen species, deconditioning, nutritional impairment, aging, and hypoxia likely play a role [20,41,42]. Importantly, inactivity and proinflammatory cytokines, common in COPD, can increase activity of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, a proteolytic pathway that causes muscle wasting [41]. All the anatomic and physiologic skeletal muscle abnormalities noted above may exist in the absence of steroid use. Steroid myopathy is an additional troubling cause of muscle weakness that can be superimposed on the other disturbances.

In turn, exercise training/PR can restore the patient to the highest level of functional capacity possible for any existing degree of ventilatory impairment.

Patients with all degrees of severity of chronic airflow limitation, including those with severe reduction in FEV^sub 1^, can benefit from exercise training [43-45]. As such, all patients with moderate or severe COPD who experience disabling symptoms of dyspnea and/or leg fatigue despite optimal medical management should be considered potential candidates for exercise training/PR [11,12,46-49], Persons with mild disease may continue to exercise to an extent sufficient to prevent deconditioning, and thus they are not routinely referred for PR. However, one general criticism of PR is that it has limited potential to affect disease outcome (such as hospitalizations or survival) when used principally for persons with advanced disease. On the other hand, successful realization of lifestyle modifications, such as long-term maintenance of aerobic fitness, smoking cessation, ideal body weight, and muscle mass have significant potential to impact overall functional status and rate of decline in lung function. Theoretically, therefore, relatively inactive persons and/or smokers (who have or are attempting to quit) with mild stages of COPD might be the most ideal candidates for PR. Berry and colleagues [45] recently demonstrated that patients with stage I (mild) COPD achieve benefits of training similar to those noted for persons with moderate to severe disease. It is not yet clear whether exercise training/PR implemented in early stage COPD can improve such disease outcomes as morbidity and mortality over the long term.

Absolute contraindications therefore include severe pulmonary hypertension with dizziness or syncope on exertion, severe congestive heart failure refractory to medical management, unstable coronary syndromes, or malignancy with bone instability or refractory fatigue. Relative contraindications include end-stage hepatic failure (where mental status impairment and overwhelming fatigue may occur), inability to learn, psychiatric instability or disruptive behavior, and lack of motivation. Persons with COPD and concomitant heart disease, particularly those believed at risk for arrythmia or sudden death, may be considered for cardiac rehabilitation as an alternative to PR. Cardiac rehabilitation shares many features in common with PR, but unlike PR is usually conducted with continuous telemetry monitoring during exercise.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25Among persons with moderate to severe COPD, the factors that distinguish persons most likely to respond to exercise training are not completely understood. One study found that persons with severe COPD and severe dyspnea assessed by the Medical Research Council dyspnea score at baseline did not achieve significant improvements in walking distance following training [50], but several other studies have shown that even persons with severe dyspnea and disease can achieve gains in exercise tolerance with exercise training [44,51,52]. Therefore, one should not exclude patients with severe dyspnea from participating in exercise training on this basis alone. Patients with a greater degree of ventilatory reserve (minute ventilation measuring [VE]/maximum voluntary ventilation) achieve greater improvements in exercise capacity following training compared to patients with lesser reserve [53,54], particularly if they also have impaired peripheral muscle strength prior to training [54]. Inspiratory muscle strength (the maximal inspiratory muscle pressure a patient can generate during an inspiratory effort, or PImax) is another predictor of gains made with exercise training [54]. Additional research, particularly that providing newer insights into the molecular and cellular basis of muscle dysfunction [41], is needed to clarify the other factors that determine the likelihood of deriving benefit from exercise training.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25The inclusion of smokers in exercise training/PR programs is controversial [55]. Although the participation of a person who is still smoking can be discouraging to other patients who have already quit, the exercise training and PR process can lead to improvements in functional status, and it exposes the smoker to a supportive environment in which he or she may be inspired to quit. Few studies have evaluated clinical outcomes of exercise training/PR for current smokers. Some data suggest that active smoking leads to biologic changes that might limit the response to exercise training. For example, smoking maintains blood CO levels that reduce the O2-carrying capacity of the blood and impairs O2 extraction by the tissues [56]. It is unclear whether smoking limits the potential benefits of oxygen therapy in attenuating exercise-induced increases in pulmonary artery pressure. Smoking can also lead to alterations in skeletal muscle fiber type (a reduced number of endurance fibers) and reduce oxidative enzyme capacity, even among healthy persons, and as such could contribute to the skeletal muscle dysfunction noted in COPD [57]. One small study found that current smokers were less likely to adhere to a 4-week PR program than ex-smokers [58]. On the other hand, Singh and colleagues demonstrated that current smokers achieved gains in exercise tolerance (shuttle walk test (SWT) distance and treadmill endurance) that were comparable to those made by nonsmokers following 7 weeks of training [59]. Likewise, Sinclair and colleagues showed no significant difference in gains in 12 min walking distance (MWD) between smokers and nonsmokers following training [60]. Therefore, active smoking is not an absolute contraindication to exercise training/PR. However, the inclusion of smokers in exercise training programs remains the subject of debate, and the long-term outcomes and cost-effectiveness of PR for active smokers as compared to nonsmokers is as yet unknown. Current clinical guidelines of the American Thoracic Society (ATS), the British Thoracic Society (BTS), and the American Association of Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Rehabilitation (AACVPR) do suggest that any patient participating in PR who is smoking actively should be strongly encouraged to enroll in a smoking cessation program [11,12,49,55], and that smoking cessation should be an important component of the rehabilitation process.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25Although disease severity does not inherently dictate candidacy for exercise training, the degree of physiologic and functional impairment does impact the optimal setting in which the training should occur. Exercise training and rehabilitation are effective in inpatient, outpatient, and home-based settings [12,61]. The advantages and disadvantages of each site are reviewed elsewhere [62]. Patients with severe functional impairment who need 24-hour medical and/or nursing intervention may benefit from inpatient rehabilitation [12]. Walking aids such as rollator walkers and gutter frames can assist in exercise training and improve exercise capacity for persons with very severe functional limitation [63,64]. Even ventilator-dependent patients who are stable medically may undergo rehabilitation with assistance from experienced staff. Outpatient, hospital-based individual or group training, usually undertaken two to three times a week, is the form of PR most widely used. However, the logistics of travel can limit program participation for some patients. While in some countries, patients who live too far to attend outpatient PR programs can undergo inpatient PR [65], this is not usually the case in the United States because of insurance limitations. Home-based or community/office-based rehabilitation can be used for patients with severe functional limitations who are not eligible for or do not have access to inpatient PR. Gains in exercise performance may be limited following home-based rehabilitation, depending on the nature of the training [66]. However, exercise training in the home may lead to better long-term maintenance of an exercise program because the lifestyle change occurs in a familiar environment [66,67].

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25Since exercise limitation usually begins with difficulty ambulating, most clinical trials of exercise training in COPD have focused on training the muscles of the lower limbs, alone or in combination with training the arms or respiratory muscles. Virtually all trials conducted over the last 40 years have shown that lower-limb training improves the exercise tolerance of patients with COPD [11,12,44,51,66-86]. Randomized, controlled trials have demonstrated consistently that lower-limb training of several types (treadmill, cycling, free walking, stair climbing, or a combination of these), undertaken in several settings, increases exercise endurance, and to a lesser extent, maximal work load (Wmax) [11,12,50,51,80,86-88]. Increases of up to 80 m (10%-25%) in walking distance [50,51,53,80,89-91], 10 min in treadmill endurance [87,92], 5 min (~70%) in cycle ergometry time at submaximal work loads [51,71,93,94], and 36 percent in Wmax [94] have been reported following 6 to 12 weeks of training. By way of example, Ries and colleagues compared the effects of 8 weeks of comprehensive PR (including the core process of twice-weekly cycle ergometry exercise training) to education and medical management alone in 119 patients with severe, stable COPD [87]. Patients who received exercise training achieved a 10.5 min increase in treadmill walking endurance, which was associated with a concomitant decrease in the symptoms of breathlessness and leg fatigue during exercise. These benefits were maximal at the completion of training and were maintained over several months. Although the magnitude of benefits declined gradually over time, significant improvements over baseline persisted for 1 year following the training. Two recent meta-analyses of the effects of PR have confirmed the benefits of exercise training on exercise tolerance. In one, review of the results of 14 randomized controlled trials of PR demonstrated significant favorable effects of PR on exercise tolerance [95]. Cambach et al. analyzed clinical trials assessing the long-term effects of PR in patients with COPD or asthma and also demonstrated significant improvements in exercise endurance (measured by 6 MWD) and maximal exercise capacity up to 9 months postrehabilitation [89]. Short-term inpatient PR also leads to improvements in exercise tolerance for persons with COPD [52,96,97].

Details regarding these gains and the tools used to measure these outcomes have been reviewed elsewhere [12,49,99-101]. Aerobic conditioning undertaken in PR also leads to reduced depression and improved cognition and neurobehavioral function for persons with COPD [102,103]. Some studies have noted benefits regarding return to employment [11]. Importantly, participation in PR can also lead to reductions in COPD exacerbations [104] and time spent in the hospital [96,105]. In turn, these benefits could ultimately impact disease survival. Finally, PR has been shown convincingly to be a cost-effective health care intervention, when one considers the cost of providing the program relative to the costs of health service use over time for persons who do not participate in rehabilitation [106]. Indeed, higher functional status following PR is a strong predictor of survival in persons with advanced COPD [107].

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25Based on the existing medical literature, an evidence-based guidelines report prepared and published jointly in 1997 by the American College of Chest Physicians and the AACVPR has led to the recommendation that exercise training be included routinely in the rehabilitation of patients with COPD [11]. The ATS [12] and BTS [49] Statements on Pulmonary Rehabilitation and the Global Obstructive Lung Disease Guidelines on management of patients with COPD [108] also support the position that any patient with moderate to severe COPD and exercise or activity limitation who lacks contraindications should undergo exercise training, particularly of the lower limbs. Persons who lack access to formal comprehensive PR or supervised exercise training should be given a home-based exercise program to follow. A recent study cautions, however, that the expected gains in endurance are less when patients are given only education and verbal advice and guidance about exercise, as compared to participating in a supervised exercise program [109]. The structure and duration of the program do affect program outcomes. The type of training and the target exercise intensity will be considered further in a later section. In general, existing guidelines recommend that exercise training for patients with COPD be undertaken at least 2 to 5 days per week, for at least 20 to 30 min per session [12] over an 8 to 12 week period [12,49]. Although exercise and education sessions are conducted twice weekly in many outpatient programs, one recent study cautions that twice weekly exercise may not be sufficient for some patients to achieve gains in walking distance and health status [110]. The recommendations for exercise training in the above-noted current clinical guidelines are summarized in the Table.

However, several recent trials have confirmed the presence of training benefits up to 2 years following PR [87,91,104,111]. For example, Troosters and colleagues [91] demonstrated persistence of improvements in 6 MWD, Wmax, maximal oxygen consumption (VO^sub 2^max), and QOL 18 months after a combined multimodality endurance and strength training program. The randomized-controlled trial conducted by Guell and colleagues [104] showed improvements in 6 MWD, with reduced dyspnea and improved QOL (measured by the Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ) [112]) that persisted 2 years following a 12-week program of daily supervised exercise, breathing retraining, and chest physiotherapy for persons with moderate to severe COPD.

It is well known that the effects of training are lost among healthy persons if exercise is discontinued [113]. Several factors influence the continuation of exercise after PR, including motivation, family/social support, logistics of the living environment, and disease stability. Persons whose disease is clinically stable who continue to exercise following training may be most likely to maintain improvements in exercise tolerance [114]. However, maintenance of exercise is often interrupted by COPD exacerbations, which can lead to worsening functional impairment. Further research into maintaining exercise gains following PR should also address the best means of preventing functional decline and maintaining exercise performance in the face of exacerbations [114].

In this regard, the question of whether patients benefit from sequential, repeat outpatient PR programs has been addressed [115]. In one study, successive, yearly PR led to repeated short-term gains in exercise tolerance and reduction in yearly exacerbations, but did not result in additive long-term gains in exercise tolerance [115]. It is still unclear whether reduction in exacerbation frequency that results from repeated participation in PR programs could alter the disease outcome, such as by improving survival.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25Formal exercise maintenance programs are an alternative strategy that can help maintain the benefits of the initial rehabilitation. However, outcomes of such maintenance programs have been variable [90,92,116], and to date no formal clinical practice guideline has been established. In a study by Swerts and colleagues [116], continued participation in a supervised exercise program over an additional 12 weeks was needed to maintain gains in walking endurance made initially in PR for a period up to 1 year. In a randomized trial, Ries and colleagues found that patients who, following PR, underwent a 12-month maintenance program (of weekly telephone contact and monthly supervised reinforcement sessions) had better maintenance of exercise tolerance and health status, with reduced hospital days during the intervention period, compared to persons in the control study group who did not participate in the maintenance program [117]. There were, however, no long-term differences between the two groups resulting from completion of the maintenance program. Other studies have failed to show any better preservation of exercise tolerance or QOL following participation in a maintenance program [90,118,119]. Thus, at present, there is no conclusive indication that a structured maintenance program of exercise and/or psychosocial support affects the long-term outcome following PR/exercise training.

The potential for achieving greater overall gains in exercise tolerance (and other factors such as smoking cessation, dietary adherence, anxiety, and dyspnea management) with a longer program must be weighed against the issues of adherence to the program and the potential for higher program costs. In one randomized-controlled trial [120], patients with severe COPD who underwent a 7-week course of PR showed no significant differences in endurance from those who attended a 4 week course, although improvements in dyspnea and health status were greater in those who had 7 weeks of rehabilitation [120]. In another trial [121], 18 months of exercise led to greater improvements in walk distance, stair-climbing rate, performance of an overhead task, and self-reported disability, compared to a traditional 12-week exercise program. However, the true impact of the noted additional benefits on day-to-day activities is not known, and the cost-effectiveness of a longer intervention has not been measured. With regard to cost and program duration, the study by Clini et al. [97] demonstrated that a short, intensive inpatient PR program (conducted in Italy), with up to 12 sessions held 5 days per week, led to comparable gains in exercise tolerance at a lower cost, compared to a longer outpatient program (exercise three times per week for ~8 weeks). The decreased cost was attributable to fewer total sessions and the elimination of transportation costs. It is not clear whether a similar cost result could be achieved in a hospital setting in the United States, given the strict criteria for admission to inpatient rehabilitation and the different health care reimbursement climate. Nevertheless, it is clear that shorter programs of 2 to 3 weeks that include a sufficient number and type of training sessions can also lead to improved exercise tolerance [97,98]. Patient gender may also influence the desired program duration [122].

To this end, efforts are under way to develop physical activity monitors that can assess more thoroughly the degree of activity before versus after exercise training [123].

While all types of training can improve exercise performance, different outcomes can be expected depending on whether the patient undertakes aerobic endurance versus strength training, whether high- or low-intensity training is chosen, and whether upper-limb and/or respiratory muscle training is pursued in addition to lower-limb training. No single exercise formula can be considered ideal for all persons. The exercise program must be individually tailored to meet the needs and goals of the patient, using resources available.

Walking, running, cycling, stair climbing and swimming are examples of endurance training exercise. In contrast, strength training involves bursts of activity over a shorter period, such as occur during weight lifting. Each of these forms of training can be undertaken at high or low intensity; that is, at high or low percentages of the patient's individual maximal work capacity for the given task. Many clinical trials of exercise training in COPD, such as the study by Ries and colleagues [87], have used aerobic endurance exercise such as cycling as the principal or sole mode of exercise training. As reviewed above, lower-limb aerobic fitness training leads to gains in exercise endurance, and to a lesser degree, gains in maximal work load [11,12,49,87]. Fewer studies have evaluated the impact of strength training as a sole exercise modality for persons with COPD. Resistance training improves leg strength and walking distance in healthy elderly persons [124]. Simpson and colleagues demonstrated a 73 percent increase in cycling endurance time at 80 percent of maximal power output following 8 weeks of weight lifting training of the upper- and lower-limb muscles of patients with COPD [125]. Of note, there was no concomitant improvement in 6 MWD. In another study, weight training of the upper and lower limbs led to improved muscle function and treadmill walking endurance in patients with mild COPD who had impaired isokinetic lower-limb muscle function prior to training [126], and the noted improvements in muscle strength correlated with improvements in muscle endurance. The relative advantages and disadvantages of high- versus low-intensity strength training for persons with COPD are as yet unknown. Safety, especially prevention of muscle tears, is of paramount importance, particularly for persons on chronic steroid treatment who may be at risk for muscle rupture (e.g., biceps) when exposed to a high-intensity load. Clearly, such rupture can lead to prolonged, if not permanent, additional functional disability. A recommended approach for strength training prescription has been reviewed recently [127].

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25Since both aerobic fitness/endurance training and weight training can be beneficial and are safe for patients with COPD (when administered properly), most rehabilitation programs currently use both types of training. The best way to combine these training strategies is, however, still unclear. Spruit and colleagues compared the effects of dynamic strength exercise to those of endurance training (walking, cycling, and arm cranking) during a 12-week rehabilitation program in 48 patients with severe COPD [128]. Significant improvements in muscle force and torque, 6 MWD, Wmax, and health-related QOL were noted for patients in both groups, and the two training types led to a similar magnitude of gains. However, the substantial intersubject variability raised questions as to whether some subjects may have derived benefit more from one versus the other form of training. Bernard and colleagues conducted a randomized trial of 12 weeks of aerobic endurance training, alone or in combination with strength training, in 36 patients with moderate to severe COPD [68]. Whereas muscle strength increased to a greater degree in the combined training group, the addition of strength training to aerobic endurance training did not lead to greater improvements in peak work rate, 6 MWD, or QOL assessed by the CRQ. More recently, Ortega and colleagues also compared the effects of 12 weeks of strength training, endurance training, or a combination approach in 47 patients with COPD [129]. Greater improvements in submaximal exercise capacity were noted among persons who had endurance training as part of their regimen, and greater improvements in muscle strength were found in subjects whose regimen included strength training. Overall, similarly to the study by Bernard [68], there was no clear noted additive or synergistic effect of combination therapy on exercise performance as compared with either modality alone, and the training effects were consistent with the type(s) of training undertaken.

Also, the ability to perform day-to-day activities may be a more important outcome to detect beneficial effects, as compared to a limited profile of program-based, standardized strength and endurance tests. However, as noted, a limited number of tools exist to accurately assess and quantitatively measure ADL performance. Thus, since both interventions are generally safe, it is reasonable to include both aerobic and strength training in the exercise program of most persons with COPD.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25In general, high-intensity exercise is considered to be that which takes place at greater than 60 percent of the patient's VO^sub 2^max or Wmax, whereas lower intensity exercise is conducted at lower work rates. Historically, several methods have been used to define the exercise intensity used in clinical trials of exercise training in COPD. The use of target heart rate (HR) may not be a reliable indicator of consistently chosen target work rate in this patient population. The HR at estimated lactate threshold varies as a percentage of predicted peak HR, and percentage of heart rate reserve (HRR) [130], and a specific HR achieved during training may correlate to variable work rates, depending on the severity and stability of the cardiopulmonary disease over time. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET), wherein the work rate is measured directly, is the most direct means of assessing exercise intensity [131]. However, comprehensive CPET is not mandated in all patients prior to PR, and it is not available at all centers. The incremental SWT [132] is an acceptable noninvasive alternate field test that can be used to guide training intensity. Performance in this test correlates well to VO^sub 2^max measured during an incremental CPET. Thus, a specific target training work load can be derived from the maximal speed achieved during the SWT [49]. Persons with very advanced disease and severe functional impairment who are unable to perform standardized walk tests or CPET can be exercised to the tolerable limits of dyspnea and/or leg fatigue.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25A separate issue is how to measure whether physiologic changes associated with improved aerobic fitness have occurred following training. CPET is the standard means of measuring VO^sub 2^max, Wmax, and lactate threshold, and of comparing values before and after exercise training [133]. Muscle biopsies can be used to detect structural and metabolic changes following training, but are usually conducted for this purpose only in a research setting. More recently, it has been appreciated that biomarkers such as exhaled nitric oxide (NO) may be of use in assessing the physiologic response to exercise training. Exhaled NO has been identified as a marker of physical fitness in healthy subjects [134]. Increases in exhaled NO have also been associated with improvements in exercise tolerance following PR for persons with COPD [135,136]. The routine clinical utility of this measure is as yet unknown.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25High-intensity exercise must be undertaken for the patient to gain significant physiologic improvements in aerobic fitness. Characteristic physiologic changes indicating improvements in aerobic fitness following exercise training include increased muscle fiber capillarization, mitochondrial density and oxidative capacity of muscle fibers, and delay of the onset of anaerobic metabolism during exercise (i.e., ability to exercise to a higher work rate before reaching the anaerobic/lactate threshold). These factors in turn lead to reduced ventilatory requirement for a given exercise task, increased VO^sub 2^max and decreased HR for a given oxygen consumption (VO^sub 2^). The demonstration of improvements in one or more of these variables following exercise training in patients with COPD is evidence of physiologic improvement in aerobic fitness.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25For many years, the efficacy of exercise training was questioned, since persons with severe FEV^sub 1^ impairment were thought to be too ventilatory-limited to achieve gains in aerobic fitness [137]. Subsequent studies have shown convincingly, however, that many (although not all) patients with severely impaired lung function can tolerate moderate- to high-intensity endurance training and can achieve significant physiologic gains in aerobic fitness [44,71,79,94,138,139]. For example, Casaburi [71] compared the effects of cycle ergometry training (45 min/day for 8 weeks) at a high-intensity work load (mean 71 W) to those following training at a low-intensity work load (mean 30 W) in 19 patients with moderate COPD (FEV^sub 1^ 56 + or - 12% predicted). Training led to reductions in lactate production and VE requirement for identical work rates in both groups, but the magnitude of physiologic improvement was much greater in the subjects trained at the high work rate. Also, cycle endurance time increased by 73 percent in the high-intensity group, and by only 9 percent in the low-intensity group. Maltais et al. also demonstrated physiologic gains in aerobic fitness following 12 weeks of exercise training (30 min/day, 3 days/week) at a work rate corresponding to 80 percent of the VO^sub 2^max in persons with severe COPD (FEV^sub 1^ 36 + or - 11% predicted) [44]. Similar improvements in physiologic parameters of aerobic fitness following high- but not low-intensity endurance training have been confirmed in several additional studies [139-142].

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25Importantly, whereas moderate- to high-intensity exercise is needed to make gains in aerobic fitness, it is not always necessary that the exercise intensity be so high that the patient reaches anaerobic threshold [79,82]. Improvements in VO^sub 2^max and maximal treadmill work load and reduced symptoms of dyspnea and fatigue can occur following moderate- to high-intensity exercise, even among persons who do not reach anaerobic threshold [82]. Moreover, not all patients can tolerate high-intensity exercise at the outset of training. It likely is important, however, that such patients exercise to the maximum intensity tolerated to achieve gains in aerobic fitness. Those who do can achieve gains in the maximum intensity of exercise tolerated over time. This was demonstrated by Maltais and colleagues [79], who evaluated 42 patients with severe COPD (mean FEV^sub 1^ 38 + or - 13% predicted) at baseline and after 12 weeks of cycle ergometer endurance training. Although the intended target training intensity was 80 percent of Wmax, the actual average tolerated training intensity by week 2 was only 24.5 + or - 12.6 percent Wmax for this group of patients. However, by week 12, the same patients were able to exercise, on average, at 60 + or - 22.7 percent of Wmax. Patients not only achieved significant increases in Wmax from training, but also made significant improvements in VO^sub 2^max and had reductions in VE and arterial lactate concentration for exercise at a given work rate following training.

Two recent studies have confirmed the efficacy of interval training in improving exercise tolerance [143,144]. Importantly, interval exercise more closely resembles the type of exercise output required for ADEs than does continuous high-intensity exercise. The physiologic response to interval training depends on the precise structure, i.e., nature and intensity, of the program, and on the study population chosen. Physiologic gains in aerobic fitness can occur.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25Moderate- to high-intensity training likely leads to improved aerobic fitness, at least in part by enhancing the activity of skeletal muscle oxidative enzymes. Maltais and colleagues found reduced activity of the oxidative enzymes citrate synthase and 3-hydroxyacyl Co A dehydrogenase before training in 11 persons with severe COPD. The activity of these enzymes increased significantly after high-intensity exercise training, and the noted improvement correlated to the reduction in lactic acid during exercise [44]. Moreover, reductions in ventilatory requirement following training are associated with increased Vt and lower respiratory rate, with a resultant decrease in Vd/Vt [94]. Reduction in the activity of the proteolytic proteasome pathway of metabolism is another mechanism by which physical training may lead to improved muscle function [145].

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25It is important to consider whether any detrimental effects of high-intensity training exist for persons with COPD. A few studies have addressed this issue. To determine if high-intensity exercise leads to diaphragmatic fatigue, twitch diaphragmatic pressure was measured during cervical magnetic stimulation before and at sequential intervals after high-intensity cycling exercise (to the time of intolerable symptoms) in 12 patients with moderate to severe COPD [146]. Of the 12 subjects, only two developed evidence of contractile diaphragmatic fatigue, whereas the majority of patients tolerated high-intensity exercise without adverse effect. However, in a different type of study, Orozco-Levi found that the diaphragm muscle in patients with COPD may be susceptible to sarcomere disruption, and this effect can be exacerbated by threshold inspiratory loading [147]. It is not clear whether such injury could be induced by high-intensity exercise. Quadriceps fatigue has been reported following high-intensity exercise [30]. One further study cautions that, although endurance exercise improves muscle redox potential in healthy persons, moderate intensity training can lead to reduced muscle redox capacity in patients with severe COPD [148]. Such an effect could potentially lead to worsened, rather than improved, skeletal muscle function in some patients, by virtue of exaggerating oxidative stress. Further work is needed to clarify which patients are at greatest risk for this potentially detrimental training effect, and which are likely to improve oxidative enzyme capacity following training. Identification of persons who may be at risk of diaphragm fatigue and exaggerated oxidative stress or other detrimental training effects, and an understanding of the impact of these effects on exercise tolerance and functional status long-term, would be useful in designing optimal exercise strategies for individuals.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25Finally, it must be noted that improvement in the physiologic parameters of aerobic fitness following high-intensity exercise is not absolutely necessary to achieve improvements in exercise tolerance. This is important, since (1) high-intensity exercise may lead to a greater degree of dyspnea/leg fatigue and may therefore be less likely to be incorporated into the patient's routine life-style; (2) some persons cannot tolerate high-intensity exercise, and (3) as noted, some may develop deleterious muscle effects. Moreover, it has not been proven conclusively that aerobic fitness (with such physiologic gains as increased VO^sub 2^max and decreased lactate, VE, etc.) results in better improvement in day-to-day functional capacity than lower intensity exercise (which does not lead to these physiologic training effects).

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25It has been demonstrated clearly that lower intensity exercise also leads to improved exercise tolerance, even in the absence of measured physiologic gains in aerobic fitness. For example, striking gains in treadmill endurance without increases in VO^sub 2^max were noted in the randomized-controlled trial of outpatient PR conducted by Ries et al. [87], as well as in another study evaluating the effects of low-intensity isolated peripheral muscle exercise in 48 patients with severe COPD [149]. Low-intensity multimodality exercise training also led to increased exercise tolerance for patients undergoing inpatient PR [52]. Gains in endurance and/or strength may be seen following such low-intensity exercise training. Two recent studies have directly compared the clinical benefits of high- versus low-intensity exercise training [141,150]. In these trials, gains in exercise endurance were noted following both types of training, although the magnitude of gain was greater among the patients who had higher intensity exercise. However, the study by Normandin [150] found that the low-intensity training group had greater increases in arm endurance, and both groups achieved comparable reductions in overall dyspnea, functional performance, and health status.

In one, improvements in muscle strength and endurance, whole body exercise endurance, and dyspnea were noted following NMES [151]. Compliance with the regimen was excellent and, notably, subjects were able to continue the training regimen despite the occurrence of intermittent disease exacerbations. Similarly, Bourjeily-Habr and colleagues demonstrated that transcutaneous electrical stimulation of the lower-limb muscle led to improved quadriceps and hamstring muscle strength with associated improvements in distance completed in the SWT [152]. Importantly, in both of these studies, the noted benefits were achieved even without conventional concomitant strength or endurance training. Transcutaneous electrical muscle stimulation may be particularly beneficial for patients with very severe disease who are unable or unwilling to participate in a conventional exercise training program.

However, gains in peripheral or respiratory muscle strength [153-157], increased mechanical efficiency of performing exercise due to improved neuromuscular coupling and coordination, reduction in hyperinflation/improved lung emptying, reduced anxiety and dyspnea, and improved motivation may all play a role [158,159]. Different combinations of mechanisms likely result in the improvements noted in individual persons.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25Relatively few studies examine the use of upper-limb exercise training for patients with COPD. The studies evaluating the rationale for and outcomes of arm training for COPD patients have been reviewed elsewhere [11,12,159]. In brief, arm training has been studied because patients with moderate to severe COPD, particularly those with mechanical disadvantage of the diaphragm due to lung hyperinflation, have difficulty performing ADLs that involve the use of the upperlimbs. Also, arm elevation is associated with high metabolic and ventilatory demand [160-162], and activities involving the arms can lead to irregular, shallow, or dyssynchronous breathing [163,164]. Celli et al. have postulated that an altered breathing pattern may result from de-recruitment of accessory respiratory muscles from their work as muscles of inspiration to contribute to arm activity [164,165]. Upper-limb exercise may cause a shift in the load of breathing to the mechanically disadvantaged diaphragm, with resultant ventilatory limitation during arm activities [166]. Although skeletal muscle dysfunction plays a significant role in exercise limitation of the low-erlimb, the dyspnea experienced during arm exercise is likely more related to the above-noted patterns of muscle use, and is less likely primarily dependent on inherent skeletal muscle dysfunction of the upperlimb. Indeed, studies of the anatomical and physiologic derangements of skeletal muscle in COPD have demonstrated that upper-limb muscles are affected to a lesser degree than lower-limb muscles [22,167,168]. This is likely due to the patient's tendency to eliminate first those activities that involve the muscles of ambulation, leading to overall deconditioning. In contrast, arm activities are still required for maintenance of self-care and independent living, even if they induce uncomfortable symptoms of dyspnea and fatigue. Nevertheless, improvements in upper-limb strength or endurance resulting from training could lead to improved overall functional capacity and ability to perform ADLs.

Reported benefits of upper-limb training in COPD include improved arm muscle endurance [170] and strength [125], reduced metabolic demand associated with arm exercise [171], and improved sense of well-being [77]. In general, benefits of upper-limb training are task-specific; that is, improvements are noted only in performance of the types of tasks for which the muscle groups were trained [169,172]. Since upper-limb training is generally safe, does not necessarily require use of specialized equipment, and is easily incorporated into most exercise programs, the AACVPR/ACCP Joint Evidence-Based Guidelines Panel [11] and the ATS Statement on Pulmonary Rehabilitation [12] recommend that upper-limb training be included routinely as a component of the rehabilitation of patients with COPD. Further study is needed to determine whether routine use of arm training, particularly when combined with lower-limb training, can lead to consistent improvements in overall endurance and the ability to perform ADLs.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25Since respiratory muscle dysfunction plays an important role in exercise limitation for COPD patients, inspiratory muscle training has also been investigated, in hopes that gains in respiratory muscle strength and endurance might lead to improved exercise tolerance and decreased dyspnea. The relative advantages and disadvantages of resistive loading, threshold respiratory muscle training, and isocapnic hyperventilation have been reviewed [159]. Threshold-type ventilatory muscle training (VMT) is generally the most easily quantitated mode of training because of the ability to set and standardize the training load. Pursed-lips breathing and diaphragmatic breathing are additional techniques used to optimized ventilatory function at rest and during exercise for persons with COPD. Of note, diaphragmatic breathing can increase the work of breathing, inspiratory loading, and dyspnea in some persons [173,174]. It is most likely detrimental in persons with severe hyperinflation, poor diaphragmatic movement during inspiration, and little increase in Vt when using the diaphragmatic breathing technique [175]. On the other hand, persons with COPD with a relatively low-Vt, rapid respiratory rate breathing pattern, whose Vt increases with diaphragmatic breathing, may benefit from the use of this technique.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25Clinical outcome studies of VMT have yielded conflicting results. In general, existing data suggest that the training undertaken must be sufficient to result in an improvement in PImax if improvement in ventilatory muscle or overall exercise endurance is to be expected [11]. A training load of at least 30 percent of the pretraining PImax is necessary to improve muscle strength [11,176]. Some recent studies have used a training load of up to 60 percent of pretraining PImax. It is still unclear whether there is additional clinical advantage to training at this higher intensity [177]. VMT usually requires the use of the muscle-training device 15 to 30 min per day, 5 or more days per week, for at least 2 to 6 months. When an adequate training load is delivered, VMT can lead to improvements in inspiratory muscle strength (measured by PImax) [177-184], respiratory muscle endurance [177-180,183,185,186], and reduction in ventilatory demand at a given level of exercise [187]. Some studies have also demonstrated that VMT leads to improvements in exercise endurance (assessed by distance in MWD or incremental SWT) [187,188], and gains in maximal exercise capacity [189]. Perception of dyspnea, both at rest and during exercise, decreases [178,186,188], and healthrelated QOL improves [188] following VMT. Conflicting results have been reported when VMT is added to exercise training of the limbs: some studies have demonstrated that VMT in combination with general exercise training leads to greater improvements in exercise endurance (e.g., timed walk distance) compared to exercise training alone [185,190], while others have not [78,180].

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25It remains unclear which patients will benefit most from VMT. Since VMT is generally safe and noninvasive, requires simple equipment, and can be undertaken independently by the patient in the home setting, it is reasonable to offer VMT for persons who remain symptomatic with dyspnea and exercise limitation despite peripheral muscle strength and/or endurance training [11]. Patients with respiratory muscle weakness (e.g., due to malnutrition/cachexia, generalized debility or corticosteroid use) may benefit the most [178]. It is less clear whether persons with normal respiratory muscle strength and normal respiratory mechanics, or who have inherent normal muscle strength but decreased PImax due to impaired respiratory mechanics caused by hyperinflation may benefit from VMT. Indeed, the diaphragm of COPD patients has a higher degree of neurological activity than that of healthy persons [15], and the diaphragm of patients with severe COPD and hyperinflation has a histologic and metabolic profile of trained, rather than deconditioned muscle [191,192]. In addition, there are other morphological adaptations that occur as a result of chronic diaphragm shortening [15]. Collectively, these changes may lead to a chronic "spontaneously trained" state of the diaphragm. Ramirez-Sarmiento and colleagues recently evaluated external intercostal and vastus lateralis (control) muscle fiber type, as well as inspiratory muscle strength and endurance before and after supervised inspiratory muscle training at 40 to 50 percent of PImax versus sham training in a group of patients with severe COPD [193]. Study patients were not malnourished, hypoxemic, or taking corticosteroids, and they had no significant comorbid metabolic, neuromuscular, or orthopedic disease. Those included for study had hyperinflation evidenced by elevated residual volume percent predicted and normal baseline inspiratory muscle strength. Inspiratory muscle training led to improvements in inspiratory muscle strength and endurance that were associated with a 38 percent increase in the proportion of type I (slow-twitch, oxidative, fatigue-resistant) endurance fibers and a 21 percent increase in the size of type II (fast-twitch, glycolytic) fibers in the external intercostal muscle. Thus, even persons with normal baseline inspiratory muscle strength can, after selected training regimens, achieve improved respiratory muscle function after VMT. It is not clear as yet, however, how and whether such improvements translate into improved ability to perform ADLs and/or affect health-related QOL. Further investigation is needed to identify the subgroups of patients and training regimens most likely to yield optimal benefit from VMT.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25Several strategies exist that can complement and augment the benefits of exercise training in selected COPD patients. The role of supplemental oxygen and noninvasive assisted ventilation as adjuncts to training are reviewed in this issue and elsewhere [194]. Nutritional support can be an important adjunct intervention to improve exercise performance for COPD patients, since malnutrition and cachexia, as well as obesity with relatively low muscle mass, are common coexisting afflictions [194-196]. Finally, in recent years, tremendous interest has arisen in the potential role of anabolic hormone therapy in improving the skeletal muscle dysfunction and exercise limitation associated with COPD. The rationale for use of these interventions is based on several findings. First, as mentioned, low muscle mass in COPD correlates with decreased strength and exercise endurance, as well as increased use of health care resources [34-36], impaired QOL, and reduced survival [195]. As such, interventions that could increase muscle mass have the potential to improve exercise performance and QOL. second, anabolic hormones such as testosterone, growth hormone, and insulin growth factor-1 (IGF-1), the major mediator of growth hormone's anabolic action on muscle [18], are important for muscle growth and development. Testosterone and IGF-1 levels are lower in some patients with COPD than in healthy persons [18]. Third, androgen supplementation leads to improved lean body mass and muscle strength, both in eugonadal and hypogonadal men without COPD (reviewed by Casaburi [18]). Thus far, short-term therapy appears relatively safe in older men. The safety of androgen or growth hormone administration to women is less clear and requires further study. Testosterone administration to females can lead to masculinization, disturbances of lipid balance, and mood changes, and its effect on breast cancer risk is not fully clear [18].

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-25To date, there exist only a small number of clinical outcome studies of anabolic hormone replacement/supplementation in COPD. In one study, 4 months of treatment with oxandrolone (an anabolic agent used to assist weight gain for persons with other medical conditions) was well tolerated and led to significant increases in body weight and lean body mass in patients with involuntary weight loss and moderate to severe COPD [197]. These gains were associated with improved 6 MWD in approximately half the study subjects. Schols and colleagues evaluated the effects of caloric supplementation versus supplementation plus low-dose nandrolone decanoate or placebo in 217 patients with COPD [198]. All patients also participated in an exercise training program. Among patients with nutritional depletion, nutritional intervention alone led to a predominant increase in fat mass. Addition of nandrolone led to increases in fat-free mass that were associated with a slight increase in respiratory muscle strength. There was no noted increase in 12 MWD in this study. Similarly, 27 weeks of oral treatment with the anabolic steroid stanozolol in addition to inspiratory muscle and cycle ergometer exercise training led to an increased body weight and lean body mass in 10 nutritionally depleted patients with COPD, but the noted weight gain did not result in improved 6 MWD or maximal exercise capacity [199]. Moreover, in a fourth trial, 3 weeks of daily administration of growth hormone also increased lean body mass but did not improve muscle strength, 6 MWD, or maximal exercise capacity in 16 patients with COPD attending a PR program [200]. Thus, overall, clinical outcomes of anabolic hormone supplementation have been disappointing, in that they have failed to demonstrate significant improvements in exercise capacity despite improvements in lean body mass. However, further work is needed to clarify the potential role of these treatments for patients with COPD since (1) selected subgroups may benefit more than others, and (2) we may not as yet have identified the optimal anabolic hormone regimen and type of concomitant training program needed to achieve benefits. Finally, the potential roles for novel treatment strategies such as IGF-1 or pharmacologic agents that could alter muscle lactate production or affect phosphocreatine synthesis remain to be investigated [194]. Further understanding of the cellular and molecular basis of muscle and weight loss, the role of systemic inflammation and other factors leading to muscle dysfunction in COPD should help elucidate future useful strategies for improvement of exercise capacity for persons with COPD.

More than 90,000 are nonimmigrant tourists, business people, students, and workers who are welcomed at airports and border crossings. About 3,000 are immigrants or refugees who have been invited to become permanent residents of the United States, and more than 1,000 are unauthorized foreigners, usually Mexicans, who evade border controls, enter the United States, and settle.1

There is no single answer, which helps to explain why Americans are ambivalent about immigration. The United States has always celebrated its immigrant heritage, and American leaders often recount the story of renewal and rebirth brought by newcomers from abroad. Yet Americans have worried since the days of the founders about potential economic, political, and cultural change caused by immigration.

In the after-math of the terrorist attacks, the U.S. government took steps to identify potential terrorists in the United States and prevent others from entering. Political leaders stated clearly that they did not want to shut the door to immigrants and legitimate visitors, but they did want to keep out terrorists and those who support them. Today, the United States is grappling with the right balance between welcoming foreigners and protecting Americans.

Beginning in the 188Os, the United States began to bar certain types of foreigners-including prostitutes, low-skilled contract workers, and Chinese-ushering in the phase of qualitative restrictions on immigration. In the 1920s, the United States developed the current qualitative and quantitative restrictions on foreigners wishing to immigrate. A major policy change in 1965 switched priority for entry from people with particular national origins to those with relatives in the United States and foreigners whom U.S. employers wanted to hire. The result was a shift from mostly European to mostly Latin American and Asian immigrants.

Illegal immigration also rose in the 1990s, making immigration a contentious public policy issue in the 21st century.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-26Immigration and the integration of foreigners are much-debated issues; the debate is framed by the extreme views of those who advocate "no immigrants" and those who advocate "no borders." The Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), for example, charges that immigrants contribute to population growth and environmental degradation, displace low-skilled American workers, depress wages, and threaten the cultural bonds that hold Americans together. Consequently, FAIR calls for a sharp reduction in immigration-from 1 million a year to perhaps 300,000 a year-which FAIR feels would have the added benefit of allowing recent arrivals and Americans time to adjust to one another.

After the Sept. 11 attacks, the Journal still advocated high levels of immigration, chiefly for their economic benefits: More people mean more consumers and more workers, which helps the economy grow.2 Groups such as the Organization of Chinese Americans and the Emerald Isle Immigration Center favor immigration from particular countries or regions. The Catholic Church and some other religious organizations oppose immigration controls because they believe that national borders artificially divide humanity.3 Other groups support continued immigration because they think it is a defining part of the American national identity.

Yet immigration also brings many changes that raise fundamental questions for Americans. Who are we? What kind of a society have we built, and whom shall we welcome to it? What should we do to encourage the integration of newcomers? How should we deal with those who arrive uninvited?

U.S. immigration policy will continue to change in response to immigration flows and their impacts on Americans. Resolving the fundamental economic, social, and political issues raised by immigration requires weighing the choices or trade-offs between widely shared but competing goals in American society.

The volume of immigration flows has been increasing since the 1950s. The average annual inflow was about 320,000 immigrants in the 1960s, 430,000 in the 1970s, and 630,000 in the 1980s. The origins of immigrants have also been changing. During the 1960s, 40 percent of legal immigrants were from Europe. In the 1990s, less than 13 percent of immigrants were from Europe, while 51 percent were from Latin America and another 30 percent were from Asia (see Figure 1).

Changes in immigration law can skew the immigration statistics for certain years. For example, more than 1.8 million people were granted immigrant status in 1991, although many had lived in the United States for years-1991 marked their change to legal immigrant status under legalization programs of 1987 and 1988.

(The fiscal year runs from Oct. 1 to Sept. 30.) There are four types of front-door immigrants. The largest category consists of relatives of U.S. residents. In FY2001, 63 percent of immigrants were granted entry because family members residing in the United States petitioned the U.S. government to admit them (see Table 1).

In fall 2002, Mexican permanent residents could expect to wait seven years for their spouses and children to be granted immigrant visas, and U.S. citizens from the Philippines sponsoring brothers and sisters could expect to wait 21 years.4

Employment-based immigration includes multinational executives, workers holding professional or advanced degrees, clergy, and wealthy investors, as well as low-skilled and unskilled workers and priority workers with "extraordinary ability" in the arts or sciences. In 1990, some U.S. businesses and other groups feared a shortage of skilled labor. Congress, in the Immigration Act of 1990, raised the annual limit on the number of employment-preference immigrants from 54,000 to 140,000 a year; this limit may be exceeded if slots are left from a previous year. In FY2001, nearly 180,000 employment-based immigrants were admitted.

About 85 percent of the "principals" who receive employment-based visas are already in the United States under temporary worker or other nonimmigrant status, and then adjust to resident immigrant status.5 The process of testing the U.S. labor market for U.S. workers-labor certification-is not always closely supervised, however, and is subject to abuse.6

About 26 percent of the refugees who arrived between FY1999 and FY2001 were from Ukraine and other countries of the former Soviet Union, 21 percent were from Cuba, and 18 percent were from Bosnia-Herzegovina.

Nationals of countries that sent fewer than 50,000 immigrants in the previous five years, and who meet specific educational and other criteria, may apply for one of 50,000 diversity visas. The applicants are chosen by lottery from between 9 million and 12 million applicants annually. Many applicants are found to be unqualified: Only 42,015 diversity immigrants were admitted in 2001.7 Because many Asians and Latin Americans are admitted in other categories, most diversity visas go to people from such African and European countries as Ghana, Nigeria, Poland, and Ukraine.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-26The diversity program addressed an unintended consequence of the 1965 amendments to U.S. immigration law. Giving priority to family unification meant that, after 1965, U.S. immigration policy favored people who already had ties to U.S. residents. These laws strengthened existing networks and perpetuated this chain migration. Immigrants from countries that had not recently been sending immigrants, such as Ireland, found it difficult to establish the family and business networks needed to set chain migration in motion. During the first three years of the program, 40 percent of diversity visas were reserved for Irish immigrants. The "other immigrants" category also includes Cubans and Central Americans already in the United States who can petition for immigrant visas if they can demonstrate that they would suffer extreme hardship if they were sent back home.

The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) estimated that between 1901 and 1990, the number of people emigrating from the United States was equivalent to about 31 percent of the number immigrating. Emigration peaked during the Great Depression of the 1930s, when more people moved out of the United States than moved in. Emigration during the 1980s was estimated to be 1.6 million, equivalent to about 22 percent of immigration.8 The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that 220,000 foreign-born residents emigrate each year.

The United States is eager to attract most types of nonimmigrants-airlines and hotels advertise for foreign tourists, for example-so there are few quantitative limits on most categories of nonimmigrants. The number of nonimmigrants tripled in the past 20 years, primarily because of the growing number of tourists and business visitors.

The statistics are somewhat confusing: A foreign worker who enters more than once during a year is double-counted because the statistics record admissions rather than people. There were almost 1 million admissions of temporary foreign workers in FY2001; 40 percent were professionals coming to the United States with H-1B visas to fill jobs that require at least a bachelor's degree. Workers with H-1B visas are allowed to bring their families with them and to adjust to immigrant status if they can find a U.S. employer to sponsor them during the six years they can remain in the United States. In FY2001, nearly half of the H-1B workers were from India, and most were employed in computer-related jobs. During the dot-corn boom of the 1990s, the annual limit of 65,000 H-1B visas was reached well before the end of each year, and computer firms twice persuaded Congress to raise the annual limit to 195,000.9

Those in favor of expanding H-1B admissions argued that U.S. employers needed easy access to the "best and brightest" of the world's workers and that the U.S. government should not erect barriers between U.S. employers and the foreign workers they need. Employers argued that foreign students dominate graduate school programs in math, science, and engineering and that it should be expected that U.S. employers would want to hire the best graduates of U.S. universities.

The critics point out that most students graduating from U.S. universities with bachelor's degrees in science and math are U.S. citizens, but most do not pursue advanced degrees because the extra earnings and opportunities seem insufficient to warrant the time, effort, and expense of graduate school. Critics of the H-1B program emphasize that high-tech firms interview and hire fewer than 2 percent of job applicants, suggesting no shortage of potential employees. A 1996 report on the H-1B program by the U.S. Department of Labor's inspector general concluded that the program should be abolished because most U.S. employers use it as a "probationary employment tryout program for illegal aliens, foreign students, and foreign visitors," so that the program winds up legalizing foreigners whom the sponsoring employer has already hired.10

Foreign students account for a larger share of the student body at costly private universities than at less expensive public ones. Most students pay their own expenses. The IIE reports that foreign students contribute about $12 billion annually to the U.S. economy.11

In an effort to track foreign students, the federal government launched the Student Exchange and Visitor Information System (SEVIS) in 2002. Colleges must report data on foreign students so that the government is aware of foreigners who were admitted to the United States as students but did not enroll in classes.

Unauthorized foreigners, also referred to as illegal aliens, deportable aliens, or undocumented workers, are persons in the United States in violation of U.S. immigration laws. An estimated 350,000 to 500,000 illegal aliens settle in the United States each year; many more stay for a while and leave within the same year. The INS apprehended 1.4 million in FY2001, 95 percent of whom were Mexicans caught just inside the U.S. border. The same person may be caught several times, and each apprehension is counted separately.

In such areas as San Diego-Tijuana and El Paso-Juarez, apprehensions have fallen sharply. However, many migrants have turned to smugglers to help them enter illegally through the deserts and mountains of Arizona. The smugglers, known as polleros or coyotes, typically lead groups of 20 to 40 migrants across the border. They sometimes abandon those who cannot keep up or fail to provide water or make transportation arrangements for the migrants once they are in the United States. For the past several years, an average of one migrant a day has died attempting illegal entry.12

Some of the unauthorized foreigners in the United States are waiting for immigrant visas. In October 2002, 1 million applications were pending for foreigners in the United States seeking to adjust their status to that of immigrant. A foreigner who is found to have been in the United States unlawfully for more than a year may be barred from legal re-entry for 10 years. Thus, unauthorized foreigners waiting for immigrant visas walk a tightrope, hoping to the receive immigrant visas before they are detected, removed, and barred from legal re-entry for 10 years.

In 2001, some 176,984 foreigners were deported or "removed" formally from the United States; 80 percent of them were from Mexico. Mexicans apprehended inside the United States who choose to be returned "voluntarily" to Mexico are fingerprinted, photographed, and taken across the border, but usually they will not be prosecuted if they are apprehended again in the United States. An unauthorized foreigner who is removed or deported, however, must appear before an immigration judge who decides the foreigner's fate after listening to the immigration service argue why the foreigner should be deported and the foreigner argue why he or she should be allowed to remain. Deported foreigners can be prosecuted if they re-enter the United States.

In a 2002 poll, 55 percent of the public said legal immigration should be reduced, compared with 18 percent of opinion leaders.18 Many politicians and researchers dismiss public concerns about immigration by pointing out that, throughout U.S. history, fears that the United States was accepting too many and the wrong kinds of immigrants proved unfounded. Benjamin Franklin, for example, worried that German immigrants arriving in the late 1700s could not be assimilated. Why, he asked, should "Pennsylvania, founded by the English, become a colony of aliens, who will shortly be so numerous as to Germanize us, instead of our Anglifying them?"19 Less than two centuries later, a descendent of those immigrants, Dwight Eisenhower, was elected president of the United States. At the end of the 20th century, some immigrants who adopted U.S. citizenship have been entrusted with high-level public office, including former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright (born in Prague) and former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General John M.

Politicians remind Americans that they share an immigrant legacy. In light of this revered immigrant heritage, those who want to restrict immigration may be considered un-American. They often justify their position with the following arguments:

In the 17th and 18th centuries, English colonists established the framework of the society that became the United States. They built communities at Jamestown and Plymouth, seized control from the Dutch in New York, and overran various French and Spanish settlements. These colonists established English as the public language and England's common law as the model for the U.S. legal system.

The Louisiana Purchase of 1803 made Americans out of the French residents living in that territory. Mexicans in California, New Mexico, and Texas became Americans in 1848, as a result of the Mexican War. In 1898, the United States acquired Puerto Rico in the settlement of the Spanish-American War; Puerto Ricans became U.S. citizens in 1917.

In 1789, after the former British colonies had become one country, the word "immigrant" entered the language to denote a person who voluntarily moves from his or her own country to another established nation. Immigrants and their descendants, along with the colonials, the slaves, the American Indians, and their descendants, are the American people of today.

The English made up 60 percent of the population in 1790, but there were also Scots, Scots-Irish, Germans, and people from the Netherlands, France, and Spain. These migrants were motivated by a mixture of religious, political, and economic factors. German sectarians sought religious freedom in Pennsylvania; Spaniards looked for Christian, converts in Florida and the southwest; and the Puritans in Massachusetts sought to establish a community restricted to members of their faith. Religious freedom was made possible by political and economic freedom: the absence of coercion by overlords and the chance to prosper in a new land.

Starvation, disease, and shipwreck probably killed more than one in 10 of those who set sail for America. While African slaves were transported to America under horrific conditions and considerable loss of life, historians estimate that immigrants died at an even higher rate than slaves en route to the New World. Slaves often had more food and protection than ordinary passengers because the death of a slave was a business loss for the owners who had arranged their passage.20 The cost of travel was equivalent to four to six months of a laborer's wages in England, and many potential immigrants indentured themselves to employers in the United States who would pay for their passage. Indentured workers were legally bound to work for as long as five years for the employer who paid their passage. One-third of immigrants arriving in 1776 had become indentured to secure passage.

Peasants displaced from agriculture and artisans made jobless by the Industrial Revolution were desperate to escape from Europe. New arrivals sent what came to be called "American letters" back to Europe, encouraging friends and relatives to join them. Steamship and railroad companies sent agents around Europe recruiting customers.

About 40 percent of these second-wave immigrants were Irish escaping extreme poverty and famine in their home country. Roman Catholics predominated in the second wave, and by 1850 the Roman Catholic Church was the largest denomination in the United States, though Protestants of various denominations outnumbered Catholics.

During the third wave, over 20 million southern and eastern Europeans came, mostly to the eastern and midwestern states. Several hundred thousand Chinese, Japanese, and other Asian laborers settled in the western states.

Of those arriving in 1882, 87 percent came from northern and Western Europe, and 13 percent came from southern and eastern Europe. Only 19 percent of immigrants arriving in 1907 were from northern and Western Europe, while 81 percent were from southern and eastern Europe. The immigrants who arrived in 1907 also included the first large numbers of people of Jewish and Eastern Orthodox religions.

More than 1 million immigrants arrived annually in six of the first 14 years of the 20th century. By 1910, foreign-born residents accounted for nearly 15 percent of the U.S. population and about 24 percent of the U.S. labor force; immigrants made up more than half of all operatives in mining, steel, and meatpacking. Foreign-born men made up more than half of the work force in New York, Chicago, and Detroit.21

When immigrants began to arrive again after the war, in the 1920s, their entry was curtailed by the introduction of numerical limits, or "quotas." Then the severe economic depression of the 1930s discouraged foreigners moving to the United States. As Adolf Hitler's Nazi regime displaced and threatened Jews and political opponents in Europe and precipitated another world war, many called on Franklin D. Roosevelt's administration to give more generous treatment to those fleeing Nazi-controlled areas. But the United States did not admit large numbers of refugees until after World War II. Including the refugee flows, an average of 250,000 immigrants entered each year through the 1950s.

In the 1940s, about one-third of the 1 million immigrants whose arrivals were recorded were from the Western Hemisphere. The Western Hemisphere share climbed to 40 percent in the 1950s. Legal immigrant admissions did not reflect the volume of Western Hemisphere immigration, because many migrants were unauthorized. Between 1940 and 1960, for example, 360,000 legal Mexican immigrants were admitted but, in 1954 alone, more than 1 million Mexicans were apprehended and sent back as illegal entrants. Be-cause relatively few of the unauthorized Mexicans became permanent settlers, the Mexican-origin population rose slowly.

Instead of giving priority to immigrants based on their national origins, with preference to those from northern and Western Europe, the new system gave priority to people with U.S. relatives and to a small number of people with outstanding accomplishments or special skills. These changes, coupled with prosperity in Europe, altered the composition of U.S. immigrants. During the 1970s, the first decade the law was in effect, fewer than 20 percent of U.S. immigrants were Europeans.

The number of immigrants arriving annually during the peak years-more than 1 million-is about the same, although the foreign-born accounted for more of the U.S. population in 1900 (15 percent) than in 2000 (11 percent). During both periods, the economy was undergoing fundamental restructuring, from agriculture to industry in the early years of the 20th century and from services to information at start of the 21st century. Both waves brought people from countries that had not previously sent large numbers of immigrants, raising questions about language, religion, and culture.

Federal, state, and local governments; private employers; shipping companies and railroads; and churches were free to promote immigration to the United States. Some federal government policies indirectly encouraged immigration. Subsidizing railroad construction, for example, led to the recruitment of immigrant workers by private railroad companies. High tariffs kept out European goods and thus created a demand for more workers in American factories. The federal government relied on immigrants to staff the army: Immigrants made up about one-third of the regular soldiers in the 1840s, and an even higher proportion of many state militias.22

Groups of Protestant clergymen, journalists, and other opinion leaders formed the Order of the Star Spangled Banner within the party to urge reduced immigration from non-Anglo-Saxon countries. To maintain secrecy, members were instructed to answer any inquiries about the Order with the words "I know nothing about it." The American Party won 70 congressional seats in the federal election of 1854, but the majority of congressmen did not respond to the flurry of anti-immigrant feeling and no restrictions were imposed. Immigration slowed before the Civil War and slavery replaced immigration as the major political issue of the day.

The growing numbers of immigrants from eastern and southern Europe aroused concerns and fears among the overwhelmingly Protestant and rural American populace. Writing in 1901, Woodrow Wilson, who was later elected president, shared the popular antagonism to the immigrants:

In 1875, convicts and prostitutes were barred. The Immigration Act of 1882 added paupers and "mental defectives" to those who could not immigrate to the United States. And for the first time, it barred immigration from a particular country-China. The 1882 act barred Chinese immigration for 10 years, and the ban was renewed every decade until 1943.

The aim was to reduce the number of immigrants, particularly peasants from southern and eastern Europe, where literacy was low. Three presidents vetoed such literacy tests. President Wilson's third veto was overridden in 1917, and a law was passed requiring that future immigrants over age 16 know how to read in at least one language. The literacy test did not succeed in reducing immigration from eastern and southern Europe. In 1907, the U.S. House of Representatives commissioned a study that laid the foundation for using national origin as the chief criterion for selecting immigrants. The study concluded that immigrants from southern and eastern Europe had more "inborn socially inadequate qualities than northwestern Europeans."24

In 1924, it set an annual limit of 150,000 immigrants, plus accompanying wives and children. The immigration legislation of the 1920s also established a quota system-using the national origins formula-that aimed to ensure the predominance of northern and Western Europeans in the U.S. ethnic makeup. The Immigration Act of May 26, 1924, prescribed that, beginning in 1927, the maximum number of immigrants from any country would be "a number which bears the same ratio to 150,000 as the number of inhabitants in the United States in 1920 having that national origin bears to the number of white inhabitants of the United States."25 Each country was guaranteed at least 100 visas; 154,477 visas were available annually.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-26The national-origins formula gave preference to immigrants from northern and Western Europe. During the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s, more than 80 percent of all immigrant visas went to people from northern and Western European countries, 14 percent to eastern and southern Europeans, and 4 percent to people from other Eastern Hemisphere countries. The limits specified in the 1924 act did not apply to immigration from Western Hemisphere countries such as Mexico. The rise of political and racial persecution in fascist Europe in the 1930s brought no change in American immigration law. There was no special provision for refugees; all immigrant visa applicants were required to have a sponsor. Only about 250,000 of the Europeans attempting to escape persecution by the Nazis were admitted.26 After the war, Congress passed the Displaced Persons Act of 1948, which allowed in more than 400,000 Europeans. Later, the Refugee Relief Act of 1953 permitted the admission of another 190,000.

Truman and some congressional reformers sought-unsuccessfully-to abolish the discriminatory national origins system. Congress passed the McCarran-Walter Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) of 1952 over Truman's veto and left the quota system intact. In the early 1960s, President John F. Kennedy also proposed eliminating preferences for immigrants from specific regions or countries and giving priority to close relatives of U.S. citizens and foreigners with special skills and abilities that would benefit the United States. Kennedy did not live to see his bill considered, but by 1965 the momentum of the civil rights movement provided enough force to eliminate racial and ethnic discrimination in American immigration law. Under the 1965 amendments to the INA, about 80 percent of the immigration slots were given to immigrants joining family members or relatives in the United States. No limit was placed on the number of immediate relatives who could move to the United States if their U.S. relatives were citizens. For the first time, Asians were treated like other immigrants and, also for the first time, limits were placed on immigration from the Western Hemisphere.

The accelerating pace of global change has affected migration patterns, however, and Congress responded with three major changes in immigration laws between 1980 and 1990, three more in 1996, and, since 2001, antiterrorism laws that affect immigration.

From the 1950s until 1980, the United States defined refugees as persons fleeing communist dictatorships or political violence in the Middle East, and the U.S. government offered those who escaped the chance to settle in the United States. The United Nations, in the 1951 Refugee Convention, had defined a refugee differently, as a person living outside his or her country of citizenship who was unable or unwilling to return because of a well-founded fear of persecution because of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.27 With the Refugee Act of 1980, the United States adopted the UN definition both to select refugees in refugee camps who wanted to resettle in the United States and to determine whether foreigners seeking asylum in the United States deserved refugee status.

During the 1990s, the number of authorized admissions fell from about 120,000 to 90,000, and then to 70,000 in 2002 and 2003. Most refugees are resettled in the United States with the help of nongovernmental organizations such as the Immigration and Refugee Services of America, with the federal government reimbursing the organizations for the cash, medical assistance, and job and language training they provide to newly arrived refugees.28

During the 1970s, Congress, federal commissions, and the press reported on the increasing number of foreigners, mostly Mexicans, who were entering the United States and staying without permission. In 1976, President Gerald Ford appointed an interagency task force to recommend steps to reduce illegal immigration. In 1978, Congress established the Select Commission on Immigration and Refugee Policy (SCIRP) to study the effects of illegal immigration on the U.S. economy and society. SCIRP concluded that illegal migrants adversely affected unskilled American workers and undermined the rule of law and that the federal government should undertake new efforts to reduce such migration.29 The best way to deal with illegal immigrants who had put down roots, SCIRP said, was to legalize their status by granting them amnesty. The best way to discourage future illegal immigration was to impose penalties, or "employer sanctions," on U.S. employers who hired illegal immigrants.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-26The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA) embodied this historic bargain. It legalized 2.7 million unauthorized aliens and, for the first time, made it unlawful for U.S. employers to knowingly hire new workers without verifying their right to work in the United States. The legalization program succeeded in that most eligible aliens became legal immigrants. But legalization also proved to be an incentive for more illegal immigration, especially from Mexico, primarily because of the Special Agricultural Worker (SAW) program. The SAW program, through which 40 percent of the legalizations occurred, offered legalization to people who could prove they had worked for at least 90 days in agricultural jobs in the United States, but the program was riddled with fraud.30 The employer sanctions part of IRCA also did not work as intended. The INS was slow to establish effective enforcement strategies, and unauthorized workers found ways to buy false documents to present to employers.

This law raised the annual ceiling on immigration and added new immigration slots, such as the diversity visas that increased immigration from Ireland and other countries that had sent few immigrants in recent times (see Table 2).

But pressure for reform intensified, and 1996 was a watershed year for immigration legislation, as Congress approved three major immigration-related laws: the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA), and the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA).

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-26These laws were motivated by concern about terrorism, especially the role that asylum applicants had in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing; the desire to find savings to balance the federal budget and to end perceived abuses of the U.S. welfare system by immigrants; and frustration with continued illegal immigration. The 1996 antiterrorism law changed criminal law concerning foreigners, making it easier to detain without bail those aliens convicted of crimes committed in the United States and to deport them when they have served their sentences. The same law made it easier for the INS to exclude foreigners who arrive at airports without proper documents and seek asylum in the United States. Such foreigners can be subject to "expedited removal" and barred from legal re-entry if they cannot make a credible case that they face persecution at home.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-26The new welfare law radically changed the way all low-income residents, especially new legal immigrants, receive benefits. Until 1997, when PRWORA came into force, legal immigrants generally received the same benefits from the federal government as did citizens. PRWORA made most legal immigrants who entered the United States after Aug. 22, 1996, ineligible for federal means-tested welfare benefits unless they were refugees, veterans of the U.S. Armed Services, or had worked at least 10 years in the United States. PRWORA was expected to save about $54 billion in its first six years, with 45 percent of the savings coming from denying welfare benefits to legal immigrants. In 1998, however, Congress restored welfare eligibility for many legal immigrants who had lived in the United States on Aug. 22, 1996. In 2000, Congress approved Food Stamp eligibility for immigrants who had lived in the United States at least five years.

First, it called for 1,000 more border patrol agents each year for five years, bringing the total from 5,175 in 1996 to almost 10,000 by 2000, and making the INS one of the fastest-growing federal agencies. Second, IIRIRA introduced a pilot telephone verification program to enable employers to verify the status of newly hired workers and social service agencies to determine the legal status of applicants for benefits. Social service agencies must verify the legal status of those applying for benefits, but employer participation in the verification program is voluntary.

Sponsors were required to have annual incomes at least 125 percent of the poverty-line income for their own family as well as the relatives they sponsor. Under these rules, a couple sponsoring two parents for immigrant visas would have to show an income of at least $22,625 in 2002.

The Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act of 1997 (NACARA) allows Cubans and Central Americans already in the United States to petition for immigrant visas if they can demonstrate that they would suffer extreme hardship if they were sent back home. The Haitian Refugee Immigration Fairness Act of 1998 extended the same option to some Haitians in the United States.

Two of the hijacked planes were flown into the World Trade Center towers in New York City, a third slammed into the Pentagon, and the fourth crashed in Pennsylvania. More than 3,000 people were killed and thousands injured in the attacks, which also demolished the two World Trade Center towers. In the wake of these attacks, President George W. Bush declared war on terrorists and the countries that harbor them, and Congress enacted legislation to fight terrorism.

Several of the hijackers had been able to obtain driver's licenses and ID cards because states did not require proof that the applicant was in the United States legally. Although the hijackers entered the United States legally, they just as easily could have slipped into the United States illegally across the Mexican or Canadian borders.

USA PATRIOT provided additional funds for border security and granted the U.S. Attorney General the power to detain any foreigner who the Attorney General certifies is a danger to national security. The federal government detained and held in secret some 1,200 foreigners in the aftermath of Sept. 11. None were found to have terrorist links, and most were deported for violating immigration laws.

The Student Exchange and Visitor Information System (SEVIS) is designed to track students in the United States and to tighten requirements on the schools that admit foreign students for study in the United States. Visas to visit the United States are issued at U.S. consulates abroad, but the information submitted by applicants from most Middle Eastern countries must be sent to Washington, D.C., to be checked against databases operated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Central Intelligence Agency.

There had been many calls in the late 1990s to reorganize and restructure the agency, which enforced immigration laws and provided immigration benefits, such as work authorization and naturalization, but demands for sweeping change for the INS intensified after the Sept. 11 attacks. In 2003, the INS was divided into several pieces that were moved to different sections of the new Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Most immigration and naturalization services now fall under the newly created Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services. The primary border control and enforcement functions were moved to a new Directorate of Border and Transportation Security within DHS.31

Because fertility and mortality have fallen to relatively low levels in the United States, immigration's role in the growth of the national, state, and local populations has increased in recent decades. Immigration contributed one-third to one-half of the total population increase between 1990 and 2000; the foreign-born population increased by nearly 11 million during the 1990s, while the U.S.-born population grew by nearly 33 million (see Table 3). The increase in the number of foreign-born was unprecedented and somewhat unexpected. The 2000 Census count of U.S. residents was about 6 million higher than expected largely because net migration was greater than had been projected.

Until the 1990s, these effects were confined largely to the major immigration states: California, Florida, Illinois, New York, and Texas were home to 75 percent of immigrants in 1990. But the foreign-born began moving into other states during the 1990s. By 2000, these five states had only about 66 percent of the U.S. foreign-born population. States such as Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia, Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Utah saw the number of immigrants more than double in the 1990s, adding the workers many employers sought but posing challenges to these states to provide services to immigrants and their children.32

As they have children, immigrants add further to population growth and change, so immigrants and their children, the first- and second-generation Americans, are often combined to discuss the demographic impacts of immigration. In 2000, the foreign-born and their children made up 21 percent of the U.S. population. If net immigration averages 820,000 a year, first- and second-generation Americans are projected to represent one-third of the U.S. population by 2025. This is not particularly high by historical standards: Between 1900 and 1920, 33 percent to 35 percent of the population were first- or second-generation Americans.34

The U.S. median age is projected to rise from 35.3 in 2000 to 39.0 in 2050, assuming net immigration of 920,000 people annually. If there were no net immigration after 2000, the U.S. median age would be 42.8, almost four years older.36

The median age for Hispanics and Asians would be about three years older in 2025 with no net immigration after 2000 than with additional immigration. With no additional immigration, non-Hispanic whites would have a median age of 43.4 years, compared with 42.2 years with immigration.

The U.S. social security system transfers funds from current workers to retired workers. Its ability to pay benefits depends on both demography-the number of workers and retirees-and economics-the earnings and taxes collected from workers and employers.

The U.S. labor force, which was 142 million in 2000, is projected to be 152 million in 2025 with no immigration after 2000, and 170 million with immigration. There were 4.1 workers for every person age 65 or older in 2000. This ratio would drop to 2.5 workers per elderly person by 2025 if net immigration ceased after 2000. Even with immigration, however, the ratio would drop substantially, to 2.8 by 2025.37

Because immigrants have a higher fertility rate than the U.S.-born population, their presence decreases the ratio of workers to children under age 18. In 2000, there were 2.0 children per worker. Recent population projections show the ratio will be about the same in 2025, assuming current levels of immigration. With no further immigration, there would be more workers for each child, and the ratio would rise to 2.2 by 2025.38

Consequently, immigration nudges the worker-elderly ratio a little higher, meaning that there are more people of working age per person age 65 or older. Immigration has a more dramatic effect on the younger ages. Immigration after 2000 is projected to add about 15 million more children under age 18 than there would be without any post-2000 immigration (84 million versus 69 million). Continued immigration will lower the worker-child ratio and increase the child component of the dependency ratio.

Like U.S. citizens, most working-age immigrants seek jobs, earn wages, pay taxes, and consume public services. In 1997, the National Research Council (NRC) concluded that legal and illegal immigration add between $1 billion and $10 billion per year to the U.S. gross domestic product, largely because immigration holds down U.S. wages and thus prices and increases the efficiency of the economy.39 Immigration has a positive net economic effect, but it is a very small factor in an $8 trillion economy that normally expands by $300 billion a year.40

Who benefits and who suffers from immigration? In particular, how does the presence of new arrivals affect settled immigrants and Americans whose education and skills are similar to those of the new arrivals? How quickly do immigrants climb the American job ladder? The NRC found that most of the economic benefits of immigration accrue to the immigrants themselves, to owners of capital, and to highly educated U.S. residents. The fact that highly educated U.S. residents benefit from immigration, and that immigrants, when ranked by years of education, are at the extremes of the distribution, means that immigration tends to increase inequality.

At the other end of the distribution, about 34 percent of the recently arrived foreign-born adults had not finished high school, versus 16 percent of the U.S.-born. Because education is the best predictor of a person's earnings, these percentages help explain the growing inequality between foreign-born and U.S.-born Americans and within the foreign-born population.

In 1986, the President's Council of Economic Advisers summarized the labor market effects of immigrants as follows: "Although immigrant workers increase output, their addition to the supply of labor ... [causes] wage rates in the immediately affected market [to be] bid down. ... Thus, native-born workers who compete with immigrants for jobs may experience reduced earnings or reduced employment."41

Governments have long protected vulnerable low-wage workers by establishing minimum wages and regulating hours of work; there are also education and training programs to help workers improve their job skills and thus their earnings. The 1960s War on Poverty and civil rights movement reinforced the U.S. commitment to improving conditions at the bottom of the labor market through employment and training programs for less-skilled workers and affirmative action for workers from groups that suffered discrimination in the past.

Many of the first immigration studies were case studies that were undertaken after U.S. workers went on strike and were replaced by immigrants. When farm workers in Southern California went on strike for a wage increase in 1982, for example, many lost their jobs. The unionized workers were displaced in a competition between employers. The unionized harvesting association lost business to farm labor contractors (FLCs) who hired nonunion and often unauthorized workers. The harvesting association went out of business, and the union workers lost theirjobs.42

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-26Case studies have shown that immigration can displace established workers and depress wages by adding vulnerable workers to the labor supply. This scenario conforms to accepted labor market theory, but the actual effects on wages and employment are indirect and hard to measure. 43 Once employers begin hiring newly arrived workers through FLCs, for example, hiring and supervision can change. Local workers may not learn about job vacancies if the FLCs find additional workers by asking current employees to bring in their friends and relatives. Such network hiring helps explain why many garment shops in New York or Los Angeles have Mexican, Chinese, or Thai seamstresses, but not a mixture of the three. Network hiring also explains how the owners of office buildings in Los Angeles in the 1980s came to replace unionized U.S.-born black janitors with immigrants hired by cleaning contractors.

They begin with the assumption that, if immigrants depress wages or displace workers, then the more immigrants there are in a city, the greater the observed wage depression or job displacement will be. Econometric studies might study the influence of immigration on the wages and unemployment rates of blacks, Hispanics, and women in Los Angeles by comparing them with similar groups in Atlanta, which has a relatively small immigrant population.

In 1990, economist George Borjas summarized the research literature by saying that "modern econometrics cannot detect a single shred of evidence that immigrants have a sizable adverse impact on the earnings and employment opportunities of natives in the United States."44 One well-known econometric study concluded, for example, that the 1980 influx of Cuban immigrants to Miami in the Mariel boatlift had no measurable negative effect on the wages and employment of local workers. During the four months of the boatlift, Miami's labor force increased by 7 percent, but there were no significant differences between wage and job opportunities for native-born workers in Miami and in other U.S. cities.45 The evidence suggested that the immigrants generated enough economic activity to offset any negative effects their presence might have on the wages or job prospects of local workers.

The most important new evidence involved studies of migration patterns within the United States, which found that workers who had to compete with immigrants were moving away from the cities that were attracting the most immigrants, presumably to avoid competing with them in the labor market. The effects of immigration on wages and unemployment in Los Angeles or Houston were thus dispersed throughout the United States in a process that demographer William Frey called "the new white flight."46

The wages of government employees, for example, are set at federal or state levels, and the earnings of many union workers are determined by national or regional collective bargaining agreements. Comparing the earnings of blacks and Hispanic immigrants may not be meaningful if a disproportionate share of the black workers are employed by the government or under union contracts. If workers who compete with unskilled immigrants move away and the workers who do not compete remain, the effect of immigrants may not be detected in the city's labor market.47

Agriculture is probably the U.S. industry most dependent on unauthorized workers. In the late 1990s, almost 50 percent of the 2.5 million U.S. farm workers were unauthorized foreigners, despite the legalization of more than 1 million illegal farm workers in 1987 and 1988. Many who were legalized moved on to nonfarm jobs, which created a vacuum that drew in more unauthorized workers and helped keep wages and benefits for farm workers among the lowest in America.

The starting point for these studies is the fact that "immigrants on average earn less than native workers [and] this gap ... has widened recently ... [as] the skills [years of education] of immigrants have declined relative to those of the native-born."48 The average educational level of immigrants has been rising, but the educational level of U.S.-born residents has risen faster, which explains the widening education gap and, by extension, the growing income inequality between foreign-born and U.S.-born Americans and within the foreign-born population.

Economist Barry Chiswick conducted research in the 1970s that found just such a catch-up pattern for immigrants who arrived in the 1950s and 1960s. The immigrant men Chiswick studied initially earned 10 percent less than did similar U.S.-born men. But the drive and ambition that prompted them to migrate enabled the migrants to close the earnings gap after an average of 13 years in the United States and to earn 6 percent more than similar U.S.-born men after 23 years.49 The immigrants' motivation and ambition, it seemed, could expand the U.S. economy and raise average earnings.

In 1970, the average immigrant earned 1 percent more than the average U.S.-born worker. However, the earnings of Mexican and Central American immigrants, among others, did not catch up to the U.S.-born average. During the 1970s and 1980s, the proportion of Mexicans and Central Americans among immigrants rose, and so did the earnings gap. Mexican and Central American immigrant men had 25 percent to 40 percent lower earnings than similar U.S.-born men in 1970, and 50 percent lower earnings in 1990. Instead of catching up to Americans in earnings, Borjas concluded, immigrants could add to the low-income population.50

In an industrial economy, moving from self-employment to a paid job usually brings better pay and benefits. Self-employed farmers may leave the land to seek employment in cities, for example. Self-employment is usually countercyclical: It increases during recessions and declines when the economy is booming. When rural migrants lose their jobs in the city, for example, they may return to the land and self-employment. In the service economy, "self-employment rises during recessions when regular jobs may be harder to find and laid-off executives may enter self-employed 'consulting.'"52

In 2002, however, only about 10 percent of foreign-born people were self-employed, versus 11 percent of the U.S.-born.54

Illegal immigrants, who also pay taxes, are excluded from almost all welfare benefits, as well as unemployment insurance and nonemergency health care services. Children living in the United States illegally, however, may attend public schools on the same basis as any citizen or legal resident.

The NRC reviewed the fiscal impact studies prepared in support of these suits and reached two major conclusions. First, an immigrant's fiscal balance-the taxes paid minus the cost of services consumed-depends primarily on the immigrant's earnings. In California, households headed by Latin American immigrants received, on average, almost $5,000 more in federal, state, and local services than they paid in taxes in 1996, largely because they had below-average incomes and thus paid lower taxes, while they had more children attending public schools than households headed by U.S.-born Californians.55

The average native-born household paid $1,200 more in taxes to cover the deficit in California. Applying these state estimates to the total U.S. population, researchers calculated that the 89 million households headed by U.S.-born people paid an extra $200 each in 1996 to cover the gap between taxes paid and services consumed by 9 million immigrant-headed households. The immigrant deficit amounted to $15 billion to $20 billion per year for the United States.56

The taxes immigrants pay are mostly income taxes withheld by the federal government. These revenues pay for social security and health care benefits for older residents. Immigrants often pay a small amount in state and local taxes because they have low earnings. The services immigrants consume, however, such as education for their children, are mostly paid for by state and local governments. These and similar findings have prompted many states to request a revenue-sharing arrangement with the federal government to deal with the fiscal impacts of immigrants.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-26Fiscal studies are snapshots of taxes paid and the cost of services provided at a point in time. If immigrants' earnings rise over time, so will their tax contributions, and the fiscal deficit may decrease. Similarly, the cost of providing education to immigrant children today could be regarded as an investment that will reward the country with higher-income workers tomorrow. The NRC analysis attempted to glean longer-term effects from these snapshots. The researchers projected future population, immigrant and native earnings, taxes, and use of government services. They also examined typical life-cycle trajectories for children who attend public schools, pay taxes during their working lives, and then rely on publicly supported health and social services after they retire.

On average, adult immigrants arriving with less than a high school education impose a net fiscal cost on the United States of $89,000 (in 1996 dollars) over their lifetimes; those with only a high school education cost $31,000 over their lifetimes (see Figure 5, page 30). Adult immigrants with more than 12 years of schooling provided a $105,000 lifetime gain for the United States-the value of the taxes they paid exceeded the value of benefits received by this amount.

In 1800, Mexico and the United States had roughly equal population size, about 6 million. In 1848, a large portion of northern Mexico was transferred to the United States by the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which ended a war that began when American settlers moved into Mexican territory and rebelled. The relatively few Mexican residents of what is now the southwestern United States became Americans, but there was little population growth until the early 20th century.

Both bracero programs were strongly opposed by U.S. unions and church groups concerned about U.S. workers, but farmers justified the program by arguing that the world wars had created an emergency situation. During the second bracero program, which lasted from 1942 to 1964, between 1 million and 2 million Mexicans gained work experience in the United States. Millions of others came illegally but eventually gained legal status. Unauthorized Mexicans found inside the United States were taken to the border, issued work permits, and returned to the farms on which they were found.

Mexicans soon learned that they could improve their chances of being selected by moving close to the U.S. border. When the bracero program was stopped in 1964 as a way to improve wages and opportunities for Mexican Americans, there were hundreds of thousands of braceros and their families living in Mexican-U.S. border cities. To provide the workers with jobs, Mexico and the United States modified their trade laws to allow the creation of maquiladoras, factories in Mexico that import components, assemble them into finished goods such as televisions, and then re-export the products to the United States. The maquiladoras never provided many jobs for ex-bracero workers-virtually all braceros were men, and the maquiladoras hired mostly women-but the new factories drew even more Mexicans to the border area.

The flow quickened after 1976 because of higher U.S. wages and a devaluation of the Mexican peso. By 1980, an estimated 1 million undocumented Mexicans were living in the United States.57 The Mexican economic crash of 1982 and the ensuing devaluation of the peso fueled more emigration. U.S. farmers and other employers turned to labor contractors to assemble crews of Mexican workers to harvest crops, clean buildings, and work in construction jobs for low wages. Employers who hired unauthorized workers faced few consequences, although their workers were subject to arrest and deportation in INS raids.

It also legalized the presence of 2.7 million unauthorized foreigners in the United States; 85 percent of the legalized workers were from Mexico.

Enforcement was underfunded and ineffective, and fraudulent documents were widely used by workers. Migration networks between the United States and Mexico were strengthened by the legalization of workers and family members. In effect, the United States put up a "keep out" sign at the border, but unauthorized foreigners inside the United States were free to respond to "help wanted" signs.

Mexico's total population was 100 million in 2000-meaning that the equivalent of 9 percent of the Mexican population had moved to the United States. Hundreds of thousands more Mexicans are on waiting lists for immigrant visas. There have been two responses to this emigration pressure: the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and stepped-up border controls.

It was designed to accelerate economic and job growth in all three countries, as the theory of comparative advantage predicts.58 Mexico proposed NAFTA as a way to solve the country's debt crisis and restore economic and job growth. Mexico had borrowed heavily in the early 1980s in the expectation that the price for Mexican oil would remain high. When oil prices fell, Mexico suffered a recession and mounting debts. Many people in the United States opposed NAFTA, fearing a rush of U.S. jobs flowing to Mexico. With bipartisan support, Congress narrowly approved NAFTA. One of the hoped-for side effects was reduced Mexico-U.S. migration.

California Governor Pete Wilson, who maintained that providing services to unauthorized foreigners accounted for 10 percent of state spending in the early 1990s, used footage of these banzai runs in TV ads to win re-election and build support for Proposition 187, the never-implemented state law meant to prevent unauthorized foreigners from obtaining state-funded services.

The United States provided financial assistance to stabilize the Mexican economy and, as President Bill Clinton said, "to better protect our borders." Mexico recovered from the crisis, but wages are still below 1993 levels. During the late 1990s, Mexico-U.S. migration continued-even accelerated-despite economic and job growth in Mexico. This continued migration gave rise to the theory that "cumulative causation" had established such strong networks linking Mexican villagers and U.S. jobs that neither U.S. border controls nor sanctions on U.S. employers who hired illegal workers would stop migrants.59 Cumulative causation explains how a migration flow, once set in motion, can assume a life of its own, much as a snowball rolling down a hill gathers speed and size, so that migration can beget more migration if underlying demand and supply factors do not change.

That increase came to be known as the "migration hump," as shown in Figure 6.

Since Iowa produces about twice as much corn as Mexico at about half the price, NAFTA was expected to displace millions of Mexican corn farmers, who were expected to switch to growing tomatoes and other labor-intensive crops for export to the United States. But growing fruits and vegetables requires capital, skills, and access to markets that most independent Mexican farmers did not have. Instead of expanding in Mexico, labor-intensive agriculture expanded in California and elsewhere in the United States in the 1990s, creating a demand for Mexican workers north of the border.

Mexico's production of labor-intensive products might increase faster if the United States enforced laws that prevent U.S. employers from hiring unauthorized Mexican workers. And just as Mexican workers can produce food in Mexico for export to the United States, they can pack meat, process poultry, make shoes, and sew clothes for export rather than moving to the United States to do these things. Guacamole, for example, is increasingly made in Mexico and exported, rather than made in restaurant kitchens in the United States.

For most of the 20th century, Mexico and the United States were "distant neighbors" whose major economic link was the migration of rural Mexicans to rural America. Mexico-U.S. relations changed in the mid-1980s, when Mexico sought to emulate the East Asian miracle economies by fostering export-oriented growth. During the 1990s, economic integration symbolized by NAFTA accelerated as Mexico-U.S. migration increased. Mexico experienced political as well as economic change, and in 2000 elected its first president from an opposition party in 70 years, Vicente Fox. Fox made improving conditions for Mexican migrants in the United States his government's top foreign priority. President George W. Bush was sympathetic, and, during the summer of 2001, Mexico pushed hard for what it called a "whole enchilada" migration package-legalizing unauthorized Mexicans in the United States, a new guest-worker program, ending deaths and violence along the border, and exempting Mexicans from U.S. immigrant visa ceilings.

Fox responded, "We must, and we can, reach an agreement on migration before the end of this very year [2001]."62 After the terrorist attacks, however, U.S. attention shifted to security against terrorism and the priority of Mexico-U.S. migration receded.63

The INS tightened its procedures to ensure that all applicants were screened for criminal records, which lengthened the wait between application and naturalization. The number of immigrants electing to naturalize fell to about 600,000 a year in FY2001 and FY2002.

This has not yet happened on a national scale. Non-Hispanic whites cast 81 percent of the votes in the 2000 election, and a higher percentage of votes in 2002, when turnout was down. In 2000, the 35 million U.S. Hispanics included 13 million adult U.S. citizens, 6 million of whom voted, accounting for about 5 percent of U.S. votes cast. Latinos cast about 14 percent of the vote in California in 1998 and 2000, but only 10 percent of the vote in 2002.

Education and age continue to be more reliable predictors of whether and how citizens will vote than whether they are U.S.-born or foreign-born. Numerous studies show that citizens with more education are more likely to vote and that, regardless of education, young people are less likely to vote than are older people. Immigrants tend to have many of the characteristics associated with a low voter turnout: They have a young age profile and below-average incomes and education, and they are less likely to own homes and more likely to belong to racial or ethnic minorities. Even after accounting for these factors, however, naturalized citizens are less likely than U.S.-born citizens to register and vote.

The balance between these competing forces changed over time, but three principles have guided what is now called integration:

The open hostility that was expressed toward certain racial and ethnic groups in the past is surprising by today's standards. In 1930, for example, President Herbert Hoover rebuked New York Congressman Fiorella La Guardia by saying that "the Italians are predominantly our murderers and bootleggers," and invited La Guardia and his Italian-American supporters to "go back to where you belong" because "like a lot of other foreign spawn, you do not appreciate this country which supports you and tolerates you."68 Today, no public official is likely to offer such advice to Chinese-American Gary Locke, who was elected governor of Washington in 1996. Governor Locke, like La Guardia, is the son of immigrants.

The Changing Relations study, which investigated immigrant communities in six cities in the 1980s, found that-despite segregation in jobs and housing and the lack of a common language-newcomers and natives in a number of U.S. cities were cooperating to achieve local goals, such as obtaining government benefits or improving their neighborhoods.69 The report also noted that, in cities with large immigrant populations, immigrants were not integrating into the broader community. Economic restructuring had created fears in many communities that immigrants threatened the jobs of longer-term residents. Integrating immigrants is likely to be different in the early 21st century than it was in the early 20th century. In the early 190Os, many U.S.-born Americans first interacted with immigrants when the U.S.-born left their farms for jobs in the cities, where both they and the immigrants were newcomers.70 Now, immigrants, are moving into and sometimes transforming established communities.

The CIR emphasized that Americanization is a two-way street. The United States expects immigrants to "obey our laws, pay our taxes, respect other cultures and ethnic groups. At the same time, [we] also incur obligations to provide an environment in which newcomers can become fully participating members of our society." The CIR recommended that federal grants be given to communities with large numbers of immigrants to create resource centers in which immigrants and the native-born could interact. The CIR also urged U.S. businesses to do more to help integrate immigrants: "Those business groups in particular who lobby for high levels of immigration must make a far greater effort not only to support immigration, but also to support immigrants, through English classes, naturalization and civic education."71

Adult immigrants commonly did not learn English well. Their children were usually bilingual, using their parents' language at home and English at school. English often became dominant as the children of immigrants entered the workplace. The grandchildren of immigrants-the third generation-typically speak only English.72

Poor English skills are associated with lower earnings in a high-tech society. Earlier immigrants could farm or work in factories or build railroads without speaking English. But in today's service-dominated economy, the ability to speak English is required for nearly all but the lowest-paying jobs. One study found that among immigrant men who did not speak English at home, those who were not fluent in English earned only about half as much as those who were.76 Another study concluded that those in the United States "who speak English 'well' or 'very well' have 17 percent higher earnings than those with less fluency."77

There are frequently long waiting lists for English classes for adults. There is no federally financed program to teach English to adult speakers of other languages, although states use federal adult education grants along with their own funds to provide English instruction.

Students who have difficulty understanding an all-English curriculum are often referred to as limited-English proficient (LEP), a term whose definition varies from state to state and between federal agencies. These students are referred to as English-language learners.

Each approach has its own philosophy and assumptions about what is appropriate for students with different linguistic backgrounds. With the ESL approach, children of various language backgrounds receive instruction in English for all subjects, but the English is modified by specially trained teachers so English-learners can more easily understand it. Teachers provide an appropriate context for the students to help them with the new language.

Older children who are new to English are taught such core subjects as math, science, and history in their home languages while they are learning English. The aim of bilingual education is to ensure that limitedEnglish students are taught material with the same intellectual content as other students while these students gain competence in English.

A report on limited-English students by the NRC concluded that the most successful school programs have three similar characteristics: some native language instruction initially for most students; relatively early phasing-in of English instruction; and teachers specially trained in instructing English-language learners.80

In June 1998, California voters approved Proposition 227, the English for the Children initiative, 61 percent to 39 percent, ending bilingual education and requiring most non-English-speaking children to be placed in special English classes for one year and then shifted to regular classes. Since then, students in English immersion classes have scored higher on math and reading than students in bilingual programs. In 2002, 32 percent of the LEP students in the immersion program passed the California English proficiency test, compared with just 9 percent the previous year. Students in bilingual programs showed less dramatic improvement, from 3 percent to 16 percent.81 Arizona and Massachusetts also ended bilingual education by voter initiative, but Colorado voted to continue teaching LEP children in their native language.82

One issue is whether newcomers should quickly be integrated into mainstream America, or whether newcomers should be encouraged to retain their distinctive cultural attributes and their native languages-and whether the public schools should help immigrants maintain their language and culture. If schools give priority to English-language learning, does that show concern for immigrants' future success in the United States, or is it "Anglo cultural imperialism"? Is bilingual education a form of minority patronage that creates public employment for members of particular ethnic groups? Should U.S. immigration policy be changed to favor people who already know English, as it does in Australia and New Zealand?

Such questions involve the public education system in much broader issues and feelings about immigrants, integration, and national character.

Overall, immigrants have minor effects-for better or worse-on the huge American economy and labor market. Most immigrants are better off financially in America than they were at home, but many arrive with minimal education and skills and find it hard to advance to better jobs in the American labor market. State and local governments, meanwhile, point out that the taxes paid by immigrants go mostly to the federal government, while state and local governments bear the brunt of the costs of providing services to the immigrants.

Instead, they live as permanent residents and keep their original nationality. Laws enacted in 1996 made noncitizens ineligible for some welfare benefits, which prompted a record 1 million foreigners to naturalize. The U.S. constitution makes U.S.-born children of immigrants citizens at birth, whether their parents are naturalized citizens, legal immigrants, or illegal immigrants.

Their isolation is reinforced by housing and job segregation and language barriers. There are many examples of cooperation between natives and immigrants, however, as well as signs that immigrant children may be acquiring English faster than did previous immigrants.

Our history and traditions suggest that, within a few decades, most of today's immigrants will be an integral part of the ever-changing American community. But past success does not guarantee that history will repeat itself. There are concerns about the size and nature of today's immigrant population. As the nation searches for an immigration policy for the 21st century, the United States, and the immigrants on their way here, are on a journey to an uncertain destination.

Immigrant visas used to be green, and immigrants are still often referred to as "green card holders." In the past, most immigrant visas were issued to foreigners at U.S. consulates in their home countries. This changed in the 1990s, and today most immigrant visas are issued by the government inside the United States.

In 1910, for example, there were only 13.5 million foreign-born residents, but they represented 15 percent of all U.S. residents.

But the sharpest increases in foreign-born residents since 1990 were in other states, such as Nevada, where the foreign-born population rose from 105,000 to 386,000 between 1990 and 2002, and North Carolina, where it rose from 115,000 to 381,000.

Demographer Jeff Passel estimates that at least 3 percent are nonimmigrants, including foreign students, diplomats, and temporary workers, and some will return to their countries of origin. Between 7 million and 9 million are unauthorized foreigners, which means that only about 75 percent of all foreign-born residents are legal immigrants. One reason for the range in the estimate of unauthorized foreigners is that some demographers count foreigners with a quasi-legal status as unauthorized, and others treat them as authorized.

A recent analysis of the 2002 CPS showed that the average age of a U.S.-born worker who worked full-time at least part of 2001 was 41 years, and median earnings were $31,200.2 For foreign-born residents, the average age was 39 years, and median earnings were $24,000. Foreign-born residents who arrived in 1990 or later-half of the total-were much younger and had much lower incomes: Their average age was 32 and median earnings $20,000. These low earnings reflect the fact that 34 percent of these recent arrivals were not high school graduates. By contrast, 16 percent of U.S.-born residents had not finished high school.

They are instead arguments about which of two goods deserves higher priority. For example, adjusting interest rates upward can lead to lower inflation, which is a desirable result, but away from fuller employment, a competing good. Similarly, reducing trade barriers can stimulate exports, which can help some employers and workers, but increase imports, which can lead to the failure of other businesses and the loss of jobs. There is no easy way to balance the trade-offs between competing outcomes.

Americans want to pay low prices for food. They also want farm workers, like other U.S. workers, to have decent wages and working conditions. To achieve both goals, Congress permitted Mexican workers to enter the United States and provide low-cost labor on farms. Congress then tried to alleviate the poverty of farm workers and their children by providing special education, health, and housing programs. But these special programs have not prevented farm workers from being among the poorest American workers.1 There are trade-offs between these competing goods-inexpensive food and decent farm wages.

Less than one-third of the $56 would go to farm worker wages and benefits. Consumers who pay $1 for a pound of apples or a head of lettuce are giving about 18 cents to the farmer and 6 cents to the farm worker.

It is hard to determine how much wages would rise if foreign workers were not available, but in 1966, one year after the end of the bracero program, the then-fledgling United Farm Workers union won a 40 percent wage increase for grape harvesters.4 Average earnings were $7.56 an hour for U.S. field and livestock workers in 2000, according to a U.S. Department of Agriculture survey of farm employers. A 40 percent increase would raise them to $10.58 an hour. If this wage increase were passed fully to consumers, the 6-cent farm labor cost of a pound of apples or a head of lettuce would rise to between 7 and 9 cents, and the retail price would rise by 2 to 3 cents.5

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-26For a typical household, a 40 percent increase in farm labor costs translates into a 2 percent to 3 percent increase in retail prices (0.175 x 0.33 = 6 percent, farm labor costs rise 40 percent, and 0.4 x 6 = 2.4 percent), so total spending on fruits and vegetables would rise by $8, from $322 a year to $330 a year. Earnings for a typical seasonal farm worker could rise from $8,000 to $11,200 a year.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-26Are the savings on fresh produce provided by lowcost immigrant labor worthwhile? The migrants are better off, earning 5 to 10 times more in the United States than they would at home. U.S. farmers and their bankers are also better off, enjoying higher profits and therefore higher land prices. U.S. and foreign consumers of U.S. commodities pay less for fresh produce. The critical question is whether these benefits are more valuable than having farm work performed and rewarded like other work in America. The way this question is answered is a major determinant of U.S. immigration policy, especially with respect to Mexico.

For integrationists, American democracy is composed of equal individuals, symbolized by the "melting pot" metaphor. For pluralists, American society is an equality of groups much like a salad with distinct ingredients. For the integrationist, what counts is what the citizen thinks and believes; the pluralist wants to preserve the citizen's awareness of where he or she came from.

The melting pot ignores the persistence of memory and the importance of the home culture. An exclusive emphasis on integration overlooks the fact that ethnic affiliation persists among many Americans after the second and third generations, long after the language and knowledge of the "old country" has been lost.

Pluralistic integration asserts that there is a common U.S. culture to which all individuals have access, but it also supports the efforts of minorities to preserve and enhance their own cultural integrity. In practice, this means that public funds should not be used to promote differences between racial and ethnic groups: "No ethnic group under these terms may have the support of the general community in strengthening its boundaries, [but] ethnic nuclei are respected as enduring centers of social action."1 Another scholar of immigration, Lawrence Fuchs, used the term "kaleidoscope" to emphasize the dynamics of change: Immigrants adapt and change, and so does American society.2

A country has a comparative advantage when it specializes in producing goods that it manufactures for less than another country can. Under comparative advantage theory, all countries benefit when each one trades goods in which it has a comparative advantage. Accordingly, if Mexico has a comparative advantage over the United States in producing TVs, and the United States has a comparative advantage over Mexico in producing airplanes, the economies of both countries will grow if Mexicans sell their TVs to Americans and buy U.S. airplanes.

Everyone recognizes 'the poor' who appear daily on the TV screens of the world. Who is unfamiliar with images of children and old people, haggard and exhausted, fleeing the war-zone in central Africa or the cyclone in Southeast Asia, the drought-stricken areas of Zimbabwe or Ethiopia; the distended stomach and discolored hair of malnourishment, the skeletal figures lying listlessly while the flies encrust their eyes? This is the 'absolute poverty' of those who have nothing, people whose lives are in constant danger from the lack of basic resources for survival.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-26 26 September 2014 United Arab Emirates flag carrier Etihad Airways has launched new livery design which will be introduced across its fleet. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-26 Created by leading brand consultants Landor Associates in partnership with Etihad Airways, the new livery is inspired by traditional Emirati design patterns, the landscapes of the desert and the geometric shapes found in the modern architecture of Abu Dhabi. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-26 The new livery was unveiled as Etihad Airways' first A380 rolled- out of the paint hangar at the Airbus Finkenwerder facility in Hamburg, Germany. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-26 Etihad said the design pattern named 'Facets of Abu Dhabi' uses a colour palette which reflects the varying hues of the landscape of the UAE, from the darker sands of Liwa to the lighter colours seen in the Northern Emirates. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-26 The design development involved researching design options amongst Emiratis and international travellers to help select the final 'winning' livery. The UAE national emblem is given prominence along the fuselage next to the Etihad name and the national flag is respectfully featured forward near the cockpit. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-26 Etihad said the design pattern is also a key feature of the new cabin interiors being introduced on Etihad Airways' Airbus A380 and Boeing 787 aircraft, and is being rolled out across the airline's corporate branding from advertising to brochures to premium lounges. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-26 The entire Etihad Airways fleet of more than 100 aircraft, as well as those to be delivered, will be painted in the new livery during the next three years ensuring that the Facets of Abu Dhabi is seen across the world.

According to news originating from Split, Croatia, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, "The aim of this study was to identify neurophysiologic markers generated by primary motor and premotor cortex for laryngeal muscles, recorded from laryngeal muscle. Ten right-handed healthy subjects underwent navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) and 18 patients underwent direct cortical stimulation (DCS) over the left hemisphere, while recording neurophysiologic markers, short latency response (SLR) and long latency response (LLR) from cricothyroid muscle."

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-28Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from the University of Split, "Both healthy subjects and patients were engaged in the visual object-naming task. In healthy subjects, the stimulation was time-locked at 10-300 ms after picture presentation while in the patients it was at zero time. The latency of SLR in healthy subjects was 12.66 +/- 1.09 ms and in patients 12.67 +/- 1.23 ms. The latency of LLR in healthy subjects was 58.5 +/- 5.9 ms, while in patients 54.25 +/- 3.69 ms. SLR elicited by the stimulation of M1 for laryngeal muscles corresponded to induced dysarthria, while LLR elicited by stimulation of the premotor cortex in the caudal opercular part of inferior frontal gyrus, recorded from laryngeal muscle, corresponded to speech arrest in patients and speech arrest and/or language disturbances in healthy subjects. In both groups, SLR indicated location of M1 for laryngeal muscles, and LLR location of premotor cortex in the caudal opercular part of inferior frontal gyrus, recorded from laryngeal muscle, while stimulation of these areas in the dominant hemisphere induced transient speech disruptions."

Under the patronage of Mr. Ali Meihad Al Suwaidi, General Manager of the Ministry of Education, 28 schools were announced winners in programs that addressed various topics, including environment, health, fitness and safety in schools, home and on the road.The ceremony is the final event to take place following a series of workshops and evaluations hosted in schools across the UAE the past three months, set up to provide participants with the opportunity to showcase and discuss what they have accomplished since the beginning of their respective programs. In addition to a fair-style set up, the ceremony included speeches given by the Ministry of Environment and Shell, in addition to videos and interactive demonstrations.As a cap to the annual program, the awards ceremony highlights the most successful school projects based on several criteria, including their ability to actively engage students, team work and presentation skills Decisions were made by a board of representatives from educational, environmental and health authorities across the UAE, including Dr. Osama Alalla, Head of Student Activities, Ministry of Education, Mrs. Mariam Al Matroushi, Director of School Health, Dubai Health Authority and Dr. Shatha Ismail from the Environment Authority-Abu Dhabi The BEA partnership between Shell and the Ministry of Education encourages school students to actively take up the cause of protecting and preserving their environment as well as their own health and safety, in both the short and long term and has been running since 1996. On a larger scale, the program also familiarizes students and the public with the environmental and safety issues at hand within the community, and suggests ways in which to address them. 2010 Al Bawaba (www.albawaba.com)

In the political tradition of "big men" in Gabon and elsewhere in Equatorial Africa to be wealthy and exercise influence depended on wealth-in-people, particularly in wives, but also including male and female slaves and slave wives.23 There is no evidence that women held formal political roles or traded actively. However, as the primary farmers, women's agricultural production was crucial to the sustenance of MpongwÃ© communities and the increased numbers of foreigners living nearby. Though men initially cleared forests, women cultivated manioc and other produce in plots (plantations) several kilometers from villages.24 As MpongwÃ© men increasingly turned towards trade in the nineteenth century, their contributions to agricultural production decreased and the numbers of slaves increased. In more affluent households, lower-status women and male and female slaves engaged in agricultural production and non-slave women ceased to farm.25

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/107/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-29Marriage was a crucial, yet contested practice for Atlantic World MpongwÃ©, establishing reciprocal obligations of assistance and networks of allies that household heads could access to strengthen social, commercial, and political status. Since exogamous marriage conferred adult status, single men and women remained rare. By the age of three or four, many girls were betrothed.26 An MpongwÃ© man seeking to crystallize alliances with another big man could offer a female dependent as a wife.27 Yet mothers could also play a key role in selecting their daughters' husbands. For women married at or after the age of puberty, some sources relay that the bride's consent was necessary, while other sources indicate that a father could marry off his daughter with or without her consent.28 Moreover, a woman was at liberty to engage in sexual relations until her family had entered into a marriage agreement for her and she left her birth family to live in her husband's household. Marriage was not a permanent relationship , as either wives or husbands could seek divorce.

In the moral and political economy of Atlantic World MpongwÃ© societies, men could accord to male visitors sexual access to MpongwÃ© women as a gesture of hospitality, in exchange for compensation, and to solidify commercial and political alliances.29 MpongwÃ© customs sanctioned some forms of married women's extramarital sex. An MpongwÃ© man could temporarily accord a male neighbor, visitor, or trading partner sexual access to his wife in an exchange referred to as asuko.30 A husband could also recognize a wife's lover as her legal lover (nokndyÃ¨) on the condition that the lover remitted the agreed-upon compensation.31

Prior to that time, marriage between MpongwÃ© consisted of the exchange of women (mipenda) between two clan groups or the groom's family remitting iron (ikwÃ¨liki) as bridewealth to the bride's family. Over the course of the nineteenth century, bridewealth consisted of imported goods and bridewealth costs increased along the Gabon coast.32 Thus, heads of households could expand their wealth-in-goods in addition to wealth-in-people through the marriage of female dependents. Bridewealth negotiations were men's domain and representatives from both parties debated the amount to be remitted based on the age, physical appearance, and work habits of the bride-to-be. Bridewealth could include items such as liquor, guns, ammunition, knives, tobacco, china, cutlery, and European clothing valued at hundreds of francs. Additionally, as a minimum requirement, an MpongwÃ© fiancÃ© had to furnish his bride with a dwelling and two years' worth of cloth.33 Escalating bridewealth costs meant that MpongwÃ© men delayed marriage until they could collect enough goods.

Three forensic psychiatrists found that Mark Bramble, 50, is "not criminally responsible for the shooting, Kanawha Circuit Judge Carrie Webster said. She dismissed the charges with prejudice, meaning they cannot be filed again.

Water plant operators along western Lake Erie have long been worried about this very scenario as a growing number of algae blooms have turned the water into a pea soup color in recent summers, leaving behind toxins that can sicken people and kill pets. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/101/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-30 In fact, the problems on the shallowest of the five Great Lakes brought on by farm runoff and sludge from sewage treatment plants have been building for more than a decade. While residents around Ohio's fourth-largest city were being told to avoid drinking tap water for a second day, discussion began to center on how to stop the pollutants fouling the lake that supplies drinking water for 11 million people.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/101/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-30"The different chemical changes produced by soil bacteria are quitenumerous. Some kinds are specialized for one series of changes, othersfor changes of a different sort. Some will attack by preferencecarbohydrates like starch or sugar, some will decompose woody tissue,some will cause the decay of proteins, some of fats, etc. Thisdivision of labor allows an effective decomposition of humus. Variousgases and acids are produced in the course of decay, and help todecompose the rock particles in the soil and to render the mineralplant food contained in them available. The insoluble proteincompounds in the roots and stubble are broken down and their nitrogenchanged partly to ammonia. The particles of ammonia, as they are thusgenerated by bacteria of many kinds, are at once pounced upon by aspecial class of germs whose function it is to change the ammonia intonitrate. Thanks, therefore, to the activities of many species ofbacteria, the nitrogen locked up in the humus and green manure istransformed gradually into nitrate, and is then quite suitable for thebuilding of roots, stems, leaves and fruit."

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/101/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-30It has required untold ages for the soils of the world to be formedand to become productive. At first the particles of rock were capableof supporting only lichens and mosses. After generations of theseplants died and added their material to the soil, it became possiblefor other plants to grow. For tens of thousands of years grasses grew,died, and decayed, enriching the barren soil with humus. Trees shedtheir leaves, and eventually fell back to the Earth themselves. Tinyroot hairs probed into cracks and crevices formed by freezing andthawing, and along with acids, broke the rocks into ever-smallerparticles. Birds and animals added to and accelerated the process.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/101/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-30Thus soils were formed, over many thousands of years, and becameever more fertile.

To make things worse, they thought they were smatter thannature: they could do the job much faster and more easily by usingtheir technical knowledge. But that's getting ahead of our story.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/101/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-30The first farming of a virgin soil has nearly always been grainfarming. (In the United States, this was due largely to economics;i.e., the industrial system. It was much easier and cheaper to shipgrain from the frontier to the population centers than it was to shipmeat, eggs or dairy products.) Grain is grown every year, with noprovision for keeping up the humus supply, either by means of barnyardmanure or by plowing under the crop residues, even straw often beingburned. Little barnyard manure is produced, and that which is iseither thrown away or allowed to lose most of its value before beingput on the land. G.F. Warren noted in 1909 that "Very few farmers inany part of America have yet learned to handle manure without losingone-half of its value." (In some regions this hasn't changed... andthe availability of chemical fertilizers has made it even worse.)

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/101/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-30The virgin soils, Warren continued, are so productive that farmersnearly always make the mistake of thinking that they will alwaysremain so. "But the constant tillage exhausts the humus supply, andthe virgin soils become less and less productive. The change is sogradual and is so obscured by the weather variations from year to yearthat the real state of affairs is often not realized until the soil isso poor that it does not pay to farm it."

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/101/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-30Even in the early 1900s, according to Warren, sometimes commercialfertilizers were resorted to. But he points out that while these mightpay for a few years, sooner or later some provision for renewing thehumus supply must be made, or the field must be temporarily abandonedto allow nature to renew the supply by growing weeds. "Many fields inthe older sections of the United States are thus abandoned for a fewyears to recuperate to such an extent that a small crop may be grown.A wiser way of farming would be to begin to raise animals for manureproduction before the soils become so exhausted."

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/101/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-30Warren said even more soil fertility was lost by wind and watererosion than by cropping. In spite of a much wider recognition ofthis, soil erosion remains a serious problem even as we enter the 21stcentury. In fact, there are places where windbreaks planted after theDust Bowl years are now being torn out to accommodate everlargerfields and equipment, and by running after short-term profits ratherthan long-term interests.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/101/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-30Warren suggested keeping the soil in sod, keeping cover crops duringthe winter, and terracing.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/101/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-30Productivity can be decreased when the soil no longer holds enoughmoisture. This can be remedied by adding humus, Warren said.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/101/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-30Constant cropping can exhaust the available supply of a specificplant food. Each crop removes a certain amount of nitrogen, phosphorusand potash (as well as others). If any one is lacking, the crop willsuffer no matter how much of the others is available. Usually it isnot a shortage of the absolute amount in the soil, but a shortage ofthat which the plant can secure in usable form.

If that was a problem in1900, it has become ten-fold worse. This affects crops in many ways.It may result in an unfavorable physical condition of the soil thatwill limit the crop even when there is no shortage of plant food. The

There is no nitrogen in stone.Nearly four-fifths of the air is nitrogen. Warren said there are over35,000 tons of this gas over every acre of land. And yet, plantsswimming in this sea of nitrogen can be nitrogen starved, yellow andsickly. That's because no plants except legumes are able to useatmospheric nitrogen.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/101/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-30Nitrogen from the air can be "fixed" by bacteria on legumes. Some ofthe old writings on farming note that pea-like plants have some effecton the soil that benefits following crops. Only in the last 150 yearshas this been explained. Until then, the Chinese saying that "beansare good for the soil" was as good as any.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/101/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-30Note that the legumes themselves do not fix nitrogen. This is doneby the nitrogen-fixing bacteria that live in the root nodules of theplants. If the right kind of bacteria are not in the soil, a legumecannot produce nitrogen, for itself or for subsequent crops.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/101/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-30But other bacteria also increase nitrogen under the properconditions. Warren cites one early study from the New JerseyExperiment Station where millet (not a legume) was grown in boxeswithout fertilizer, with one gram of nitrogen added in the form ofnitrate of soda, and one gram of nitrogen added in the form ofbarnyard manure. A fourth box got no fertilizer, no crop was grown,and the soil was kept bare.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/101/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-30The soil that was bare contained a gram more nitrogen in the fallthan it did in spring. There was a slight gain when millet was grown.When one gram of nitrate of soda was added, the crop and soil

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/101/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-30contained 3.73 grams more than was present at the beginning. But whenthe manure was used, the gain soared to 10.48 grams.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/101/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-30These gains came from the air. The nitrogen was fixed by organismsacting independently of legumes.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/101/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-30The striking results with the barnyard manure, Warren speculated,were probably due to the humus it contains, and perhaps partly due tothe organisms it brings with it. "This partly explains why fertilizersalone cannot take the place of manure."

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/101/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-30Grasses don't have the power to obtain nitrogen from the air, butwhen land is left in sod there is usually a considerable gain innitrogen. Every farmer knows (or at least used to know) that a fieldthat has been in sod for a few years produces much better crops. Thisis partly due to the humus added by the decaying roots, Warren said,and is undoubtedly partly due to the fixation of nitrogen. Probablythe humus has much to do with the nitrogen fixation.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/101/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-30"In the regions where soils have been so farmed as to becomeunproductive, the fields are commonly abandoned for one or more years,then they will produce crops again. Where the soils are not quite sofar exhausted, one or two tilled crops are grown and are then followedby hay a few years, after which small crops can once more be raised.The same principle should be applied in regular farming. Under mostconditions, the land should be in sod one to three years out of everyfive. The poorer the land, the more time it should be in sod. Iflegumes can be combined with this sod, so much the better. The sameresults may be accomplished in other ways, as by plowing down greenmanure crops."

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/101/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-30There are other organisms in the soil which accomplish the oppositeresults. They act on nitrogen compounds and break them up so that thenitrogen escapes into the air as free nitrogen. This is calleddenitrification. When manure is left in loose piles, or simply spreadon the land without being worked in, much of the nitrogen is lost bydenitrification. Composting manure is the best way to retain thenitrogen in it.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/101/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-30Nitrogen may also be lost by being made too soluble too rapidly, inwhich case it may leach out of the soil. The humus in a sandy soil islikely to be burned out so rapidly that the nitrogen may be lost inthis way.

Lime helps to improve thephysical condition of some soils, it corrects acidity, and it helpsliberate other plant foods, but perhaps its most important effect isits influence on soil organisms. If there is not sufficient lime inthe soil, the fixation of atmospheric nitrogen cannot go on properly,nor can the liberation of nitrogen from the humus.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/101/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-30"The addition of lime to the soil so favors the preparation ofnitrogen food that its effect is often the same as nitrogen. If a soil

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/101/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-30is deficient in lime it is unwise to go on farming it until thisdeficiency has been corrected. The other fertilizers or barnyardmanure cannot be used most economically if there is not sufficientlime. On the other hand, lime does not take the place of thesefertilizing materials."

This region comprises a floodplain, much like the Nile region of Egypt. The annual flooding, with its resultant deposit of silt, offered good prospects for growing food and other crops with a minimum of labor and tools. The first settlements were probably established near the Indus Delta in the south, and later ones developed as civilization spread north and east.

The civil government in the leading cities was probably under the authority of a class of priests or priest-kings, as in Egypt.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/105/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-09-30The economy of the Indus Valley depended upon crops and animal husbandry. The chief crops grown were wheat, rice, dates, melons, green vegetablesprimarily legumes, and cotton. There were large granaries. The cotton provided the impetus for the growth of the textile industry for which the Indian subcontinent has long been famous. The raw cotton was brought to the cities, where it was spun, woven, and dyed. Textiles were very likely traded with Mesopotamia, Afghanistan, and southern India.

Elephants were also in the region and may also have been domesticated.

Mohenjo-daro and Harappa were each originally about 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) square, with a large citadel, or fortress, on the west and the rest of the city to the east. The citadel at Mohenjo-daro was built upon a raised platform and contained a number of buildings, including the Great Bath in the center, granaries, and buildings for administrative functions.

In the major cities the citadel was protected by a massive defensive wall that was made of brick. The cities themselves may have been surrounded by walls, though traces of a wall around the lower town have been found only at Kalibangan.

Harappa may have had as few as 23,000 or as many as 35,000 people. The population of the whole regionan area of about 500,000 square miles (1,300,000 square kilometers) at its heightcannot be guessed. However, at least 70 population sites have been discovered within this areaa territory larger than modern Pakistan. Some of these sites, lesser in size than the four main centers, were Amri, Kot Diji, and Chanhu-daro.

There are a number of stone sculptures, cast-bronze figures, and terra-cotta figurines. Most of these are unclothed females heavily laden with jewelry, but a few standing males have also been discovered. The figurines probably represent gods and goddesses, but manysuch as animals and cartsare toys. It appears that the only painting was that done on pottery.

There is no solid evidence of places of worship, though a number of buildings believed to be temples have been excavated. It is widely assumed that there was a Great God and a Great Mother. These may have formed the basis for later Hindu belief in the god Shiva and his consort, Shakti (see Hinduism).

This letter she published in the Los Angeles Times was printed as part of a longer article in The Horn Book (December 1965), and Walt Disney survived her attack by only one year. He died December 15, 1966. Three decades later, the single subject that will ensure debate among glazed undergraduates and exhausted graduate students of children's literature is criticism of a Walt Disney production. I have learned to muffle my salvos lest Disney devotees drop the course completely, but even so, one fan was close to tears when she exclaimed, "Can't you leave the poor man alone? He's dead!" This particular class presented me with a parting shot of three plastic figurines from the Disney Studios' Beauty and the Beast -- plus the paperback spin-off.

She was a sharp critic, preceding by a decade and more the landmark commentary of scholarly theorists, from Kay Stone ("Things Walt Disney Never Told Us," 1975) to Jack Zipes ("Breaking the Disney Spell," 1993). Disney is continuously under attack by critics of both academia and the popular press for messing up revered literature -- witness the recently skewered Hunchback of Notre Dame. And Disney films are more wildly popular than ever. Is this cultural schizophrenia? The pro-Disney crowds at theaters and video stores speak in cash. The anti-Disney crowds speak in print. What's happening here? and what could anyone add, besides micro-analytic details, to Sayers's articulate assessment of the structural, tonal, stylistic, and didactic alterations with which Disney and company have "revised" traditional and/or classical stories?

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/103/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-01Perhaps we can add just a bit of perspective. Disney's films changed within the forty-three years between his first Hollywood partnership with brother Roy in 1923, the year they released a short cartoon called Alice's Wonderland, and his last hands-on production, The Jungle Book, in 1966 (released posthumously in 1967). Disney films have changed between 1966 and 1996, too, and throughout both periods, the socio-economic and aesthetic context for Disney films has been changed by almost a century of events. To the audiences of the 1920s, Disney was entertainment. To the audiences of the 1960s, Disney was an icon. To the audiences of the 1990s, Disney is myth. In the absence of a permanent electrical blackout, the Disney Olympus is centrally mapped as a pinnacle in the kingdom of childhood. With just these few words, an image may have sprung to mind of the glowing castle with myriad spires thrusting phallically toward the heavens and triangulated banners waving over all.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/103/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-01Well, now that we're here, let's look over the landscape. Obviously, the concept of fairy tale revision wasn't born with Disney in Chicago, Illinois, on December 5, 1901 (the same year Peter Rabbit was published, speaking of landmarks). In 1697 Charles Perrault refined some lusty old tales passed on by his children's nanny. In 1812 Wilhelm and Jacob Grimm made a real hit with the stories they collected from folk and family (more family than folk, as it turns out) and then revised, sometimes radically, over the next several editions of Kinder- und Hausmarchen. From 1889 to 1910 Andrew Lang stamped folk and fairy tales with his own style to the tune of ringing commercial success in a twelve-volume series starting with the Blue Fairy Book and proceeding through Red, Green, Yellow, Violet, and all the way to Lilac (multi-color literature was only a few letters short of multi-cultural, but the time wasn't ripe yet). Perrault, the Grimms, and Lang all addressed adults as much or more than children: Perrault and Lang with a wink-wink-nod-nod, and the Grimms with an agenda of glorifying-according to their lights -- a cultural heritage. Is Disney the missing twentieth-century link in a chain of clever men who borrowed stories (often from anonymous women) and broadcast them via the latest mass medium? Whatever his critics say, Disney is even more of a cultural fact now than when he was alive. Thirty years worth of successful films produced by the studio that bears his name have extended his lifetime work beyond a mortal frame.

And yet, in earlier chapters of high culture versus popular culture, they too had their share of detractors. It may come as no surprise that the folklore we so venerate today was once viewed as common and vulgar by the educated elite of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries (most notably the moralistic Sarah Trimmer and Mrs. Sherwood). Will the newly created field of "Disney Studies" legitimize animated versions during the last quarter of the twentieth century in the same way that "Folklore Studies" legitimized printed versions in the last quarter of the nineteenth century? Are the changes "frozen" into film from the print tradition any more deleterious than the changes "frozen" into print from the oral tradition?

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/103/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-01Sayers's attitude was that "folklore is a universal form, a great symbolic literature which represents the folk. It is something that came from the masses, not something that is put over on the masses .... Disney is basically interested in the market." Now, the market part is certainly still true. The Disney home videos I bought to review for this article included a snowfall of glossy pamphlets advertising The Cinderella Vacation Package, Tropicana orange juice and Pillsbury products and Cheerios (there must be a connection), and, of course, lots of Disney products in print, CD-ROM, and video format: "Play with Pocahontas, Sing-Along with Pooh, Roar with Simba and Soar with Aladdin." Favorite films are released for only a few months on the home video market and then held off the market for several years ("Sleeping Beauty is in moratorium," announced the video salesman solemnly), just to ensure ongoing consumer appetite; it's a long-term strategy that works well to create a rush on any newly released golden oldie that won't be around long. This is not to mention the myriad toy, clothing, and other products that sell because of Disney characters, copyrighted graphic motifs. Of course, in a marketplace society any product has to make money -- remember that the nineteenth-century folklorist Andrew Lang was not immune to the profits from his best-selling fairy tale series -- but the sheer sophistication and international dominance of the Disney commercial machine guarantee that a Disney version of a fairy tale or classic will be THE authorized version for millions and millions of young viewers all over the world. Do we criticize Disney simply because he is so successful in shaping so many children's imaginations into one mold? In that case, shouldn't we be criticizing the capitalist/mass media system itself (the cause) rather than its cultural freight trains (the symptom)?

But in any effort to countermand the Disneyfication of storylore, dissenting parents, teachers, and librarians are often frustrated by the film company's monolithic global influence. How many children (and adults) can we reach with alternative fairy tale variants or with classics whose originals become sausage in Disney's grinder? As he said to one of his "story men" assigned to work on The Jungle Book, "The first thing I want you to do is not to read it," adding later, "You can get all bogged down with these stories."

Does this sound as curmudgeonly as Sayers's earlier remarks? Yes, but...let's add some perspective to the rude facts, and here's where Sayers's assertions about the folk seem more questionable than her assertions about the films: "Folklore is a universal form, a great symbolic literature which represents the folk." Okay, but the folk keep changing; and although folklore is universal, the folk are not a universal unit. Further, she says of folklore: "It is something that came from the masses, not something that is put over on the masses" -- as opposed to Disneylore, obviously, but that leads us to a conundrum. Disney does come from the masses as well as being put over on the masses, which we'll discuss further in a minute. Disney films represent the same chicken-and-egg syndrome as do the Barbie dolls his heroines so closely resemble. Our society exalts the impossible body form that Barbie represents, witness Playboy bunnies and Hollywood stars who have come closest to resembling her. Clearly, Mattel didn't originate that exalted body. But the dolls do perpetuate the exaltation through advertisement propaganda and mass distribution. Of course, there's also the little-studied question of what children do with those dolls. My kids cut off all their Barbies' hair and contorted the plastic bodies into what might benevolently be called positions of advanced yoga, but we'll try to stick to theory for a little longer and set aside the question of whether or not pernicious corporations are influencing every little girl to grow up wanting to look just like her Barbie doll (or a bald guru).

Dare we look at Disneylore as a grassroots movement, as electronic myth driven by social need as well as commercial greed, as formulae of exaggerated effects a la American tall tales? As even, perhaps, a form of parody, which his wry 1922 Laugh-o-Gram films of Little Red Riding Hood, Jack and the Beanstalk, Cinderella, and others so clearly were? Indeed, Disney's Hunchback of Notre Dame -- based on a book that never, of course, was intended for children -- takes parody to dizzying heights. Why is Jon Scieszka and Lane Smith's The Stinky Cheese Man and Other Fairly Stupid Tales or The True Story of the Three Little Pigs -- along with a recent multitude of revisionist fairy tales-considered cleverly entertaining by so many children's book literati while Disney revisions, also cleverly entertaining, are deeply suspect? Why is it okay for feminists (of which I am one) to update passive heroines into active roles, or for socially sensitive library-storytellers (ditto) to omit elements of violence, racism, and other unacceptables from their story hours, and not for Disney to make changes, too? Do we really want to go graphic with heroes who trick their adversaries into eating a boiled relative, one of Brer Rabbit's escapades that somehow got left out of Disney's Song of the South? Can you just see animated blood dripping from the toes and shoes of Cinderella's sisters, per the Grimms, version, or two adorable little pigeons plucking out the sisters, eyes at Cinderella's wedding, one eye from each sister going into the church, and one eye from each sister coming back out? The folks at Disney want to make zippy productions and make everybody happy and make money, not hemorrhage all over the audience.

That charming little fellow we know as Jiminy Cricket, Pinocchio's conscience and commentator in Disney's film, was just an anonymous bug that got squashed in the be innin of Collodi's book. (Let me thank University of Illinois graduate student Bill Michtom for ranting and raving about this point.) Collodi's Pinocchio does bad stuff because he doesn't have a conscience; in Disney's version, he does bad stuff because of influence from villains. In other words, it's a lot easier to blame outer forces than inner forces, to see the evil in others rather than in ourselves or those with whom we identify. Is it the dark side, our own shadows, from which Disney protects the twentieth century? Are the children of today, who have never experienced a Depression or a World War, especially susceptible to a diet unbalanced toward the sprightly side with dancing teacups, singing seafood, twittering birds, and nose-twitching bunnies? Do there have to be quite so many animal helpers? That crowd of small mammals in Snow White seems on perpetual verge of stampede.

Certainly no one, not even Sayers, has objected to Disney originals such as Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Lady and the Tramp, and Roger Rabbit, for instance, or the various realistic nature/family dramas. What draws fire are the re-visions, the abandonment of past traditions for current values, which Disney reflects with unnerving accuracy. His first full-length feature, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937), embroidered basic fairy tale formula with Hollywood romance, slapstick humor, and a utopian alternative to the harsh competition engendered by the Depression (witness the cooperative work ethic of the seven miners and of the heroine's menagerie of housecleaners, an aspect that Terri Wright has explored in "Romancing the Tale. Walt Disney's Adaptation of the Grimms' `Snow White'").

Here we see cut-throat competition for Beauty's love in context of a violent society including a brutish suitor, a bloodthirsty mob, and a demonic insane-asylum director. While the household appliances are friendly, the Beast has acquired a vile temper, and even the animals have turned nasty, with a pack of wolves attacking Beauty, her father, and the Beast himself. The wolves, villainous role is particularly ironic because one of the earlier story's basic motifs was the transformational power of animal and human nature in balance.

May the best man win. He does, but the woman has lost in the process. It's not enough to pay lip service to women's intelligence by propping a book up in front of a gorgeous female or showing her disdain for a macho suitor, when she,s been denuded of her real power. Doesn't all this reflect an ongoing condition in our own society? Some of us don't like what we see here because we are seeing what's happening to us. Common television shows are full of it, but to watch a world-class artist like Disney glamorizing it is harder to take. On the other hand, in criticizing Disney, do we want to echo those who blame authors for producing books that reflect social problems we've created ourselves?

The 1950 hit Cinderella spends as much time on Lucifer the cat chasing Gus and the other mice as it does on the main characters. Even Cinderella's return from the ball turns into a chase scene, not just the prince following her down a flight of stairs, but a wild pursuit of the king's horsemen thundering after her carriage. This device for escalating suspense is common to most of the animated features. Disney films have turned the folklore journey into a chase. What's added? Speed and competition, both key characteristics of our society. All you have to do is look at stories mythologized on television and you'll know how much our culture reverberates to chase scenes. Journeys of westward expansion turn into cowboy and Indian chase scenes; stories of crime and punishment turn into cops and robbers chase scenes. Beauty and the Beast, a television series that started with some tonal adherence to the main characters slow-paced journeys of development, ended as a chase between Beast and the villain who stole his son (Beauty is murdered after giving birth). Disney's Beauty and the Beast is full of chase scenes instead of the journeys between castle and home that characterized Beauty's earlier journey of maturation.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/103/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-01The truth of it is that Disney's films relate less to their folkloric or literary predecessors than to their contemporary audience. While not all Disney's films have been equally popular, their reception does not depend on fidelity to any original. Pinocchio, Peter Pan, and The Little Mermaid, all of which veered wildly from Collodi's and Barrie's and Andersen's stories, were blockbusters. Alice in Wonderland, which veered wildly from Carroll's work, was a bust. The remake of 101 Dalmatians stirred up some negative response not because it changed Dodie Smith's book, but because it changed the "original" film versioni Success seems to depend on a film's fulfilling the Disney formula of visual and musical entertainment (a formula defined, circularly, by public response) and on fitting into the self-referential world established by the Disney canon.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/103/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-01This process begins with the very selection of the story itself. The Little Mermaid is the kind of persecuted female that Hans Christian Andersen loved to persecute even further (see also "The Red Shoes," "The Little Match Girl," etc.) and that Disney loved to rescue, sort of. Where are the swashbuckling heroines like Mollie Whuppie? Well, she's maybe a little too active, switching necklaces in the dark of night to trick her giant host into smashing the skulls of his own three daughters instead of Mollie and her sisters, whom he has planned to cook the next day. Tit for tat, you may say, but it would make a tough scene for the two-year-olds who swarm with their caretakers to the theater, or sit propped before their electronic babysitters. A point here: the viewing crowd has gotten younger and younger over the century we're discussing, and the venues more intimate. What stranger can you trust in your children's bedroom but a filmmaker whose sales figures depend on innocence and socially acceptable villainy? Murderous stepmothers seem to be okay; murderous fathers wouldn't be. Interesting, hunh? The Grimms, by the way, modulated their version of "Hansel and Gretel" through several editions to blame the children's abandonment first on the mother and father, then on the stepmother and father, then mostly on the stepmother.

This is where we live. We who criticize Disney have seen the enemy, and he is us. We are mistaken to speak as a voice removed from the rest of the population, as eighteenth- and nineteenth-century educators did in criticizing fairy tales and fiction, or to condemn artists as gulling the rest of the population. Disney belongs to us and we belong to him. What he does to fairy tales and classics is, in a sense, our own shadow. We don't have to like it and we don't have to keep quiet about it, but we do have to understand our own society and the lore it generates. The alternative is critical mustification. Popular culture and art are a vital dynamic. The past is always renegotiating with the present to become the future, and that requires the fresh air of our awareness.

The scenes where the film-makers risk focusing on two characters, slowly maturing transformation -- on the dance floor, for instance are moving, and the animated art is rich. However, the violation of profound elements and the frenetic pace bother me in the film just as they bother me in everyday life. Does my opinion matter? Yes, but there are better ways to express it than boycotting the film or keeping it from my kids. They live here, too. They need to know what's going on, just as I do.

In August 1612 she married William Hutchinson, a merchant. She became a follower of John Cotton, a Puritan minister of nearby Boston, and in 1634, a year after Cotton had gone to Massachusetts Bay, she sailed for the newer Boston with her husband and family, arriving in September. Her kindliness and intellect soon won her a position of influence in the community, and when she organized regular religious meetings in her home she attracted large numbers of people, including leading merchants and many ministers. At first concerned only with discussion of recent sermons, she gradually began to use the meetings to expound her own theological views, which she attributed generally to Cotton. In opposition to the orthodox "covenant of works," with its demand for righteousness in the faithful, she set forth a "covenant of grace," holding that faith alone was necessary or sufficient for salvation and that the elect were thereby relieved of the burden of sin. Her teachings were viewed by conservatives as a veiled attack on the theocratic polity of the Puritan settlements, and factions quickly formed in what came to be known as the Antinomian Controversy.

The popular notion seems to be that marijuana is a harmless pleasure, access to which should not be regulated or considered illegal. Currently, marijuana is the most commonly used "illicit" drug in the United States, with about 12% of people 12 years of age or older reporting use in the past year and particularly high rates of use among young people.1 The most common route of administration is inhalation. The greenish-gray shredded leaves and flowers of the Cannabis sativa plant are smoked (along with stems and seeds) in cigarettes, cigars, pipes, water pipes, or "blunts" (marijuana rolled in the tobacco-leaf wrapper from a cigar). Hashish is a related product created from the resin of marijuana flowers and is usually smoked (by itself or in a mixture with tobacco) but can be ingested orally. Marijuana can also be used to brew tea, and its oil-based extract can be mixed into food products.

Although multiple studies have reported detrimental effects, others have not, and the question of whether marijuana is harmful remains the subject of heated debate. Here we review the current state of the science related to the adverse health effects of the recreational use of marijuana, focusing on those areas for which the evidence is strongest.

According to Bloom, Shakespeare's characters, after nearly four centuries, continue to generate as much popular appeal as they do scholarly interest. Another literary scholar, Jan Kott, refers to Shakespeare as âour contemporaryâ because his plays never go out of style. The plays of Shakespeare have been in almost continuous production, in one form or another, since the author's death in 1616. This fourâcentury run keeps William Shakespeare as much a king of contemporary popular culture today as he was in his own time.

These films were created by a who's who of Hollywood actors, directors, and writers. The costumers and set designers for these films reâcreated a variety of settings representing everything from Shakespeare's own age to presentâday Seattle. The Shakespearean blockbusters of the 1990's, director Oliver Parker's Othello (1995) and director Baz Luhrmann's Romeo and Juliet (1996), starred Laurence Fishburne as the tormented Othello and Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes as the âstarâcross'd lovers.â Actor and director Kenneth Branagh's Much Ado About Nothing (1993) and Hamlet (1996), director Trevor Nunn's dark interpretation of Twelfth Night (1996), and director Michael Hoffman's A Midsummer Night's Dream (1999) were also wellâreceived films of the decade. More Shakespeare films were scheduled for 2000, including a musical adaptation of Love's Labour's Lost set in the 1930's and a futuristic version of the thriller Titus Andronicus.

He remained a favorite of intellectuals, who often refer to him as the Bard, the greatest of master poets. Shakespeare's plays continued to be a mainstay of literature curriculums in secondary schools and were constantly produced on the local theater scene. In the 1990's, Shakespeare festivals and theater companies around the world drew millions of people to hundreds of productions annually. A replica of Shakespeare's own Globe Theatre opened in 1997 on the original site in London. Since the new Globe's first season, hundreds of thousands of people have trooped to this openâair theater to experience Shakespeare's panorama of human comedy and tragedy performed within the theatrical conventions he helped to create.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/115/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-01Evidence of the original success of Shakespeare's plays appears in the court records of Queen Elizabeth I, who reigned in England from 1558 to 1603, and in the diaries of Philip Henslowe, an Elizabethan theater manager. Historical documents, however, reveal few details about Shakespeare himself, except that he was raised in the small town of StratfordâonâAvon, England, lived most of his adult life in London, worked as an actor, and wrote poetry for rich patrons. This lack of information led a number of scholars to question whether a lowly actor could have written so knowledgeably about subjects as lofty as royalty and the law, but most experts dismiss these doubts. Almost all literary scholars agree that William Shakespeare produced the most impressive body of dramatic writing in the history of world literature.

They present a young Will suffering from an unlikely bout of writer's block after some early successes with such comedies as The Two Gentlemen of Verona. But Viola, a young noblewoman who violates class and gender conventions by pursuing a dream to act in a London theater company, provides the romantic inspiration for Shakespeare's first tragedy and the most famous love story ever written, Romeo and Juliet.

The movie refers to Shakespeare's probable alienation from his wife, Anne Hathaway, the shameful reputation of London's theater district, Shakespeare's competition with the successful playwright Christopher Marlowe, and the Puritans' criticism of the âimmoralâ theater. The film also captures the immense popularity of Shakespeare's plays and of the Globe Theatre. The innovative design of the Globe allowed audience members to see and hear easily. Three stories of balconies wrapped around the stage and a groundâlevel, openâair âpitâ where patrons stood. Although the theater held an estimated 3,500 people, no member of the audience was more than about 55 feet (17 meters) from the performance space. During Shakespeare's association with the Globe, when London had a population of only about 250,000 people, nearly 1 million patrons attended productions at the theater. Aristocracy and royalty also patronized Shakespeare's plays at the royal palaces of Whitehall and Hampton Court.

Jonson also claimed that Shakespeare was ânot of an age but for all time.â The rival playwright's assessment proved to be accurate.

In every period since Shakespeare's death, his plays have been excerpted, spoofed, âfixed,â or otherwise amended. Writers have even supplied the tragedies with happy endings. In the late 1600's, British playwright James Howard reconceived Romeo and Juliet as a comedy, keeping the lovers alive at the end of the play. In the early 1800's, Thomas Bowdler âsanitizedâ the plays in a volume called The Family Shakespeare. Bowdler changed or omitted words that he believed were inappropriate for children. This kind of editing, or âbowdlerization,â as it came to be known, was never popular with scholars, but it did have the beneficial effect of extending the audience of Shakespeare.

Composers transformed his poetic language into scores for operas, ballets, and orchestral music. Other composers used Shakespeare's poetry and the songs he wrote for some of his plays as the lyrics of short recital pieces.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/115/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-01Shakespeare's enduring popularity is also apparent in how well his work weathered the evolving conventions of theater and the shifting expectations of the public. During some periods, people venerated him as the greatest writer who ever lived. During other times, he was attacked as a ânatural,â but ungainly genius whose plays failed to conform to standards of decency and good taste. No matter how much the public opinion varied, however, people found they could not ignore Shakespeare's work.

Nevertheless, underground performances of Shakespeare âskitsâ were commonplace during the period of Puritan rule. In the 1700's, female actors, rather than young boys, were allowed for the first time to perform women's roles, a circumstance that considerably boosted the popularity of Shakespeare's plays, particularly among male patrons.

The romantic poets of the early 1800's, on the other hand, celebrated Shakespeare's relatively humble origins and idolized him as the natural, unschooled, and spontaneous genius of romantic lore. Their praise helped transform the playwright into an âauthor,â and many people came to regard the plays primarily as texts rather than scripts for dramatic performances.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/115/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-01Changes in British theater productions also contributed to the perception of Shakespeare as an author. In the 1800's, plays were not performed in openâair theaters, but in large halls similar to modern theaters. In these new settings, playwrights of the time created dramatic spectacles that relied on elaborate and cumbersome sets. In order to produce Shakespeare plays that met the prevailing taste of theatergoers, directors stripped down Shakespeare's original dialogue. As a result, the complex characters and poetic language were overshadowed by spectacular sets depicting, for example, the military skirmishes in Henry V or the naval battle in Antony and Cleopatra.

The âspecial effectsâ robbed the plays of their rich language, so that audience members did not need to be actively engaged in listening and responding to the players on stage. Also, the high price of spectacle resulted in the staging of fewer Shakespeare plays and higher ticket prices, restricting attendance to more affluent audiences. The spectacle, consequently, relegated the playwright's words to the printed page and cost Shakespeare his popularity among the common people.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/115/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-01Intellectuals began to consider his work âtheater of the mindâ rather than of the stage. They deemed King Lear and other plays unperformable and accessible only through the written word. With this change in thinking, British scholars in the second half of the 1800's transformed Shakespeareâthe highly popular, but rude, scandalous, and even âvulgarâ playwrightâinto an elite cultural icon. They held up the image of Shakespeare the author as an authority in all matters literary, cultural, and moral. They used his plays to promote British culture and the English language throughout the world.

The great Shakespearean scholar of that period, A. C. Bradley (1845â1933), wrote Shakespearean Tragedy, in which he extols the high virtue and irreproachable morality of Shakespeare's tragic heroes. Bradley's book, which remains required reading in most modern Shakespeare courses, overlooks the various heroes' heinous crimes in favor of their courage and resolve to overcome all obstacles to their ambitions.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/115/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-01During this period, Shakespeare's plays and poetry entered the curriculum of most Englishâspeaking schools around the world. According to Shakespeare scholar Charles Frey of the University of Washington in Seattle, teachers for more than 100 years offered Shakespeare as the definitive model of correct English, effective public speaking, and high morals. Some educators used abridged collections of his plays, such as Tales from Shakespeare (1807) by Charles and Mary Lamb, to supply young people, especially girls, with properly edifying instruction. This approach resulted in âShakespearophobia,â the fear of Shakespeare experienced by many Englishâspeaking schoolchildren. Even in the 1990's, Romeo and Juliet, Julius Caesar, Macbeth, and Hamletâtragedies that emphasize the âhigh seriousnessâ of literatureâremained the plays most often studied in middle and high schools.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/115/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-01In spite of Shakespeare's uncertain reception in the classroom through much of the 1900's, performances of his plays experienced a revival as new technologiesâmotion pictures, radio, television, computers, and the Internetâled to breakthroughs in artistic expression. Shakespeare's work was easily translated into silent films because the plays had been produced through much of the 1800's as visual spectacles. Filmmakers created scores of adaptations from a wide range of the plays, most notably a silent Othello (1922), starring Academy Awardâwinner Emil Jannings, and a Hamlet (1920), starring female Danish film star Asta Nielsen in the male role of the melancholy Dane. Radio performances and sound recordings of the plays were commonplace until the rise in popularity of television in the midâ1900's. Television producers in the 1950's stripped down and adapted Shakespeare's plays to fit the format and time limitations of commercial television. Notable TV productions included the âWestinghouse Theatreâ presentation of The Taming of the Shrew, featuring actor Charlton Heston as Petruchio, and the âHallmark Hall of Fameâ presentation of The Tempest, starring Lee Remick, Roddy McDowell, and Richard Burton.

Discussion groups on his life and work sprouted online, and Web sites cropped up on every conceivable Shakespearean subjectâhis life, the Globe Theatre, staging conventions, and research about what works were the actual creations of Shakespeare. Other sites offered production schedules for the many Shakespeare festivals around the world. Production companies, such as Castle Rock Entertainment and New Line Cinema, successfully generated interest in Shakespeare films with online presentations of film trailers, summaries of the plays, interactive features, and biographical information about Shakespeare geared toward younger audiences. The theatrical and academic possibilities for the new medium represented what Shakespeare himself might have called a âsea changeâ in the way people consume and digest theater and literature. A perfect example of new theatrical forms and media influencing the performance of Shakespeare's plays is Luhrâmann's slick repackaging of Romeo and Juliet as an action film and the release of the movie trailer as a rock video on MTV.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/115/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-01Shakespeare's plays have in many ways lent legitimacy to these new media. Film, radio, television, and the Internet have, in turn, helped restore the plays to the author's original intentionâthat the words be spoken and heard, not just read. Ralph Cohen of James Madison University in Harrisonburg, Virginia, describes Shakespeare's language as âear candy.â The plays were written for audiencesâthat is listenersânot merely for spectators. Radio broadcasts, records, cassettes, and CD's of Shakespeare's plays, not to mention âtalkieâ films and television, helped restore the public's appetite for live performances of the plays. Even though the dialogue is written in verse and the vocabulary of Elizabethan English, the beauty of the language is irresistible to most audiences. As a result, most filmmakers retained Shakespeare's original words, even if they shortened the text or adapted the story to a modern setting.

In some eras, a favorite play emerged to represent the prevailing tastes and the social and political circumstances of the age. In the late 1600's and early 1700's, when the institution of slavery existed through much of the Western world, the most popular Shakespeare play was Othello, a story of an African man who rises to prominence in a white man's world. The romantics of the early 1800's favored Hamletâbrooding, shrewd, and melancholy. In the late 1800's and early 1900's, when the British Empire was at its height, the public preferred Henry V, which displayed the pageantry of a king who united the various peoples of Great Britain and extended imperial domains beyond its shores. In the late 1900's, Shakespeare's most popular play was the comedy A Midsummer Night's Dream, perhaps because of its grotesque humor and sexual ambiguities.

He rifled through famous literary sourcesâthe plays of Euripides and Sophocles, Geoffrey Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales, the 100 stories of the Decameron by Italian writer Giovanni Boccaccio (1313?â1375)âas well as ânewsâ stories of the 1500's and 1600's. From these materials, Shakespeare created stories and characters that address issues as relevant to current audiences as they were to the theatergoers of Elizabethan England.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/115/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-01In Romeo and Juliet, the young characters discover the perils of love in a world dominated by the concerns of adults. Racism motivates, at least in part, Iago's plot to destroy the title character in Othello. In Measure for Measure, a moralizing ruler demands sexual favors from a young woman in exchange for her brother's lifeâa circumstance that people today identify as sexual harassment. Through the title character of King Lear, Shakespeare explores the tyranny of selfâserving authority and the potentially disastrous expectations of parents and children toward one another. The Tempest, in which a shipwrecked man rules over the inhabitants of an enchanted island, addresses issues that include the politics of empire and colonial control. In all of these cases, Shakespeare's characteristic refusal to arrive at firm or satisfying solutions perpetuates the appeal of the plays.

The 1999 film version of A Midsummer Night's Dream aptly underscored the play's theme, articulated by actor Kevin Kline in the role of Bottom the Weaver: âto say the truth, reason and love keep little company together nowâaâdays.â Two pairs of lovers, one of whom is played by Calista Flockhart of television's âAlly McBeal,â run off into the woods near Athens, the citadel of reason, to escape the stern influence of parents and society. They are subjected to the fancy of the fairy king and becomeâas Puck, the fairy trickster, exclaimsâthe âfoolsâ of the immortals. The play is updated to Tuscany, Italy, in the 1800's, and the addition of bicycles multiplies the confusion that love introduces to young people on their own in the world for the first time.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/115/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-01Because of the relevance of these themes, Shakespeare's work is generally regarded as âuniversalââthat is, his plays are for all people in all times. Most contemporary scholars, however, prefer to characterize his plays as durable, versatile, and widely applicable. Like all great writers, Shakespeare chose story lines with themes that translate well into cultural contexts other than his own. This adaptability made possible director Richard Locraine's chilling film rendition of Richard III (1995). Locraine uses the original language of the play but recasts the English monarch of the 1400's as a Nazi leader in a fictional England of the 1930's. In Looking for Richard (1996), actor and director Al Pacino interprets the monstrous monarch as a forerunner of the modern mafia boss. The durability, versatility, and applicability of Shakespeare's work also allowed authors Toni Morrison and Gloria Naylor to successfully appropriate The Tempest in their novels Tar Baby and Mama Day. These qualities allowed Jane Smiley to reâcreate the story of King Lear in her 1992 Pulitzer Prizeâwinning novel A Thousand Acres. Because Shakespeare's themes translate into other cultural context, Kate and Petruchio from The Taming of the Shrew still rage against and tame each other in a Seattle high school in the film 10 Things I Hate About You (1999), and actor Ethan Hawke discovers there is something as rotten in New York City as there ever was in Denmark in an updated Hamlet scheduled for 2000.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02IMAGE PHOTOGRAPHTHE EVIDENCE IS OVERWHELMING that the Earths surface is warmer today than it was a century ago. As for why this is so, research by thousands of scientists strongly suggests that the cause is the largely uncontrolled and still increasing release of anthropogenic (human-caused) greenhouse gases. Yet there remain a few scientists who oppose these conclusions, claiming that either the evidence for significant global warming is unreliable or that, granting the problem, the sources are natural cycles over which we have little or no control.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02This isn't a mere academic debate. The conclusions held by leaders in a variety of fields can't help but have a profound impact on social, political, and economic policy. Thus each side has expended considerable effort to convince the public, and through it the political establishment, of the validity of its stance. But because neither has been entirely successful, particularly in the United States, policies have been inconsistent and changeable, subject to partisan wrangling, corporate lobbying, and a general inadequacy of resolve.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02The importance of the issue was most forcefully brought to the publics attention with Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita. Their unusual severity, being among the strongest ever recorded in the Gulf of Mexico, reminded a number of network newscasters of recent scientific reports predicting an increase in hurricane severity.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02For example, the article "Extreme Weather: Is Global Warming to Blame?" in the May/June 2005 E/The Environmental Magazine quoted Ruth Curry, a Woods Hole Oceanographie Institute research specialist, saying, "Sea surface temperatures all over the tropics are running 1.8 to 3.6 degrees above normal. This is due to global warming." The article's author, Jennifer Vogel, noted the relevance of this: "While ocean and atmospheric circulation is the engine of a hurricane, heat is the fuel." Her summation makes it all plain: "The general scientific consensus on climate change and hurricanes is this: Hurricanes won't necessarily become more frequent, but they will become more intense."

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02This view was further supported by Massachusetts Institute of Technology climatologist Kerry Emanuel, writing in the July 2005 issue of Nature. He reported research suggesting that violent storms originating in the Atlantic and Pacific since 1970 have increased in intensity and duration by approximately 50 percent.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02But on August 2 the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration raised its 2005 Atlantic Ocean hurricane forecast, predicting eighteen to twenty-one tropical storms: nine to eleven of which would become hurricanes and between five and seven expected to reach major hurricane status. By October 9 the season had already yielded twenty tropical storms, eleven of which became hurricanes and five that were major. By contrast, a typical Atlantic storm year has only six hurricanes with two to three being major. That this is part of a new trend over recent years emerges from the NOAA's statement that "these very high levels of activity are comparable to those seen during August-November 2003 and 2004." The conclusion would seem to be that, with global warming, hurricanes are becoming not only more severe but also more frequent. And the mainstream media is paying attention.

Toward that end, this article aims to assess that weight of evidence to see if it is, in fact, sufficiently alarming to recommend more than cosmetic action. It will also review the debate itself to see where the trouble lies and what the political dimensions of the problem have become.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02If the summarized results of thousands of scientific studies that appear in the Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Control-Climate Change 2001, The Scientific Study, hereafter referred to as the IPCC 2001 report, are valid, the answer is unambiguously that significant global warming is occurring. Yet there are still a few dissenters in the scientific community, albeit a small minority. As a result, it will be necessary to examine the evidence and the arguments on both sides.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02Climate scientists define global warming as the measured increase in the mean Earth surface temperature over a specified time interval. The most reliable data are properly averaged over land and ocean surfaces, statistically weighted according to the density of measurements within each equal-area element. The final averaging is done for the entire surface of the globe.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02So, according to the IPCC 2001 report, the Earth's surface has warmed by approximately 0.6 degrees Centigrade over the twentieth century. That is approximately one degree Fahrenheit. The warming hasn't been uniform over the globe, however. In general it has been greater over the land than the oceans and, probably for that reason, greater over the northern hemisphere than the southern. This isn't surprising given the greater thermal inertia of the oceans due to the high heat capacity of water. There is also some speculation that the greater industrial activity, hence greater greenhouse gas emission, in the northern hemisphere may have contributed. However, because the main greenhouse gases are well mixed-staying in the circulating atmosphere for a long time-this effect may be small or even negligible.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02Of particular concern is the rapid temperature rise over the last quarter of the twentieth century. The observations reviewed in the IPCC 2001 report show that the 1990s was the hottest decade on record and the year 1998 the hottest year since reliable temperature measurements were made. Reliable direct temperature measurements carry the record back into the erature measurements carry the record back into the nineteenth century. And with the use of well-established indirect methods, it has been maintained that this decade was probably the hottest over the last thousand years.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02One might think this weight of evidence for global warming is so overwhelming that the only remaining issue would be to establish the cause. However, a few additional issues need to be examined. While none of these suggest that global warming in the twentieth century didn't occur, there is still some controversy over the details of the rise. The curve of increasing surface temperature in the twentieth century shows a definite increase in the first part of the century, then an extended plateau over the years 1940 to 1975, and finally the rapid increase already discussed. Scientists ask why there were thirty-five years of no significant measured temperature rise during a mid-century period of increasing emission of anthropogenic greenhouse gases. Though industrial aerosol emissions that could have balanced the effect of the greenhouse gases were also increasing during this period, no satisfactory answer has yet emerged.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02There is another problem that involves climate modeling. The best current general circulation models have predicted that tropospheric temperatures at heights in the atmosphere of a few kilometers should track surface temperatures. But measurements show little warming at these tropospheric levels, in disagreement with the models. Current work at the Goddard Institute for Space Science suggests that the discrepancy might be corrected by a better treatment of still poorly understood aerosols, plus dynamical processes that connect the troposphere with higher-lying atmospheric layers, but a definitive explanation hasn't yet emerged.

Science isn't a collection of proved certainties: a factor often used as a reason for doing practically nothing, as if any action taken before all questions have been definitively answered is premature. But if the weight of evidence suggests a problem is both real and likely to become more serious with time, most reasonable people would say that doing nothing is the height of folly. Therefore, notwithstanding the aforementioned uncertainties, there remains the fact that an enormous body of well-calibrated observations supports the unambiguous rise in global surface temperature.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02Understanding the consensus of the scientific community, it remains necessary to ask if the likely harmful effects of global warming sufficiently outweigh the probable benefits of policies that might have harmful economic consequences. Furthermore, we need to ask about the likely positive effects of global warming? Might the news be good rather than bad?

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02There is some truth in this latter idea. Moderate global warming will enhance the agricultural productivity over parts of the globe. Climate models haven't advanced to the point of yielding accurate predictions of the detailed effects on all regional climates, but all of the more sophisticated models, in agreement with observations, predict that warming is greatest at the higher northern latitudes. Thus, for example, it seems probable that large areas of Russia and Canada could become more productive as the Earths surface warms, though this could be offset by insufficient regional rainfall, currently difficult to predict.

This has been confirmed experimentally in areas of new forest growth and annual agricultural production, which, because of the rapid growth rate of young plants, is more beneficial from the above standpoint than an old-growth forest where overall growth rates have greatly subsided.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02But are these benefits likely to significantly offset the known harmful effects of global warming? Let's review the negative consequences.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02Perhaps most disturbing is sea-level rise. Water expands with increasing temperature, causing the sea level to rise accordingly. The best evidence from observations gives a mean global sea-level rise over the twentieth century of at least one foot, corresponding to the approximately one-degree Fahrenheit mean global temperature rise. Many of the world's glaciers are also retreating and very few are growing. If greater warming should induce significant melting of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (anchored in the ocean below sea level) or, worse, a significant part of the Greenland Ice Cap, the rise in sea level could exceed twenty feet or more. The effect on major coastal cities, if warming continues, is likely to become significant by the end of the twenty-first century and will be disastrous or even catastrophic if the warming exceeds moderate increases of a few degrees Fahrenheit.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02There will be many other damaging effects of sealevel rise. The global ocean-circulation "conveyor belt" is known to be highly sensitive to temperature and salinity, resulting in so-called thermohaline circulation. Some observations suggest that the Gulf Stream, on which northwestern Europe is critically dependent, may be slowing down due to the reduced density of Arctic seawater. This water is becoming fresher from the more rapid melting of the Arctic Ice Sheet and is thus less density driven to sink into the deep ocean, providing a major driving force for the circulation at high northern latitudes. Sea-level rise will also flood many coastal wetlands critical to certain human activities and many forms of wildlife. While tough-minded "realists" may scoff at the importance of songbirds in the United States, they need to consider the role these birds play in controlling insect pests. Flooding the low-lying swamps of southern Louisiana will ensure a precipitous drop in the numbers of insectivorous migrating songbirds that are critically dependent on this area for food after their long spring migration back to North America.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02Many other damaging effects of global warming are known with near certainty. Warming increases the incidence of pathogens responsible for many human and animal diseases. Warming induces changes in weather patterns, with increasing evidence (as mentioned above) that we can expect more violent storms. Moreover, there has been a spate of recent, unusual weather extremes in Europe, from deadly heat waves (in which over 30,000 people died in 2003) to tumultuous rainstorms in southeastern Europe, to forest fires in Portugal, to drought throughout Iberia. And warming means that a smaller fraction of the Earths surface will be covered by snow and ice, which reflect sunlight more effectively than other land and sea surfaces. This increased absorption of sunlight sets in motion an unstable process that further enhances global warming.

For it is almost certain that the harmful effects will greatly outweigh the possible benefits, with many highly damaging effects already occurring.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02It is often noted by critics of the current consensus that many natural processes might contribute to global warming and that one or more of them may be the dominant driver or drivers. It is therefore necessary to look at this claim and see if it holds up.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02Examination of the mean global temperature curve for the northern hemisphere over the past millennium does reveal a fluctuating temperature of as much as 0.4 degrees Centigrade before the twentieth century. That is a sufficiently large fraction of the approximately 0.6 degree rise during the twentieth century to induce some scientists to speculate that even the recent rise, though unprecedented for the rate of change over this millennium, may have been caused by a long-period internal mode of the climate system, or by small longterm changes in the solar radiation.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02It is true that not all internal modes of the climate system are well understood. However, I am aware of no evidence for any mechanism of this kind that has been studied at length in the refereed literature and which appears likely to produce long-term global warming. Instead, this possibility remains an unsubstantiated if interesting speculation.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02This brings us to the sun, my primary area of expertise. A major effort has been underway in the National Aeronautic and Space Administration since 1979, and more recently in the European Space Agency, to obtain accurate measurements of the total solar irradiance (TSI), the flux of solar energy at the top of the Earth's atmosphere. One unambiguous result is that the TSI has varied by a small amount (no more than 0.1 percent) since 1979 over the well-known "eleven-year" solar cycle of sunspot activity. The TSI is measurably higher at solar maximum, when there are many sunspots, than at solar minimum, when there are few or none. However, this small increase in the solar flux, if simply "dumped" into the Earth's atmosphere as added heat, is insufficient to contribute to global warming. Furthermore, global warming doesn't exhibit a strong eleven-year cycle. Consequently, solar scientists have also looked for a change in the TSI over times longer than one eleven-year cycle. A recent increase should show up in the TSI measured at successive solar minima, when solar-cycle dependent processes that contribute to the TSI are largely absent. Unfortunately, the precision of the observations to date hasn't yielded a definitive result, though what evidence is available suggests there is either no change between minima or a very small change that, viewed as heat introduced into the Earths atmosphere, by itself couldn't explain the recent mean global temperature rise.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02One must note that there are further possibilities for solar influence involving the effect of solar ultraviolet radiation on our upper atmosphere, and also possible small long-term changes in the solar interplanetary magnetic field at Earth, which influences comic-ray penetration and could indirectly affect cloud formation. These are subjects of ongoing research. Notwithstanding these many efforts, no strong suggestion has emerged that any of the known solar influences are playing a major role as global warming drivers.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02The lack of a convincing argument based on solid research for any of the above hypotheses leads us to ask what we humans are doing that may be causing global warming. This leads naturally into an examination of anthropogenic greenhouse gases. Unlike the more speculative discussion of possible causes reviewed above, a very strong case can be made that carbon dioxide, in particular, is probably a significant driver, and could well be the dominant driver, of the current rapid rise in global mean surface temperatures.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02There is no disagreement over the occurrence of the greenhouse effect to which carbon dioxide contributes. If the relatively long-wavelength infrared radiation from the relatively cool (compared to the sun's emitting surface) Earth all escaped into space, the Earth would be approximately fifty degrees Fahrenheit cooler than it is. Therefore life as we know it is critically dependent on the greenhouse effect. The question becomes how much greenhouse effect is good for us. Carbon dioxide is a well-studied gas that readily absorbs Earth's infrared radiation and reradiates part of it back to the Earth, thus causing warming. We know that the concentration of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere has increased by more than 30 percent since the beginning of the industrial revolution and that this percentage is increasing rapidly today, especially as China and India industrialize. We also know that carbon dioxide is so well mixed in our atmosphere that once there it will remain for more than a century unless we actively remove it. Thus, to stabilize the concentration of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere and prevent ever more efficient greenhouse warming, we will need to reduce the emission of carbon dioxide well below current rates of production-unless some powerful new "sink" for removing the gas can be developed. Even doing that won't likely lead to a stable situation for several decades; this is because of the aforementioned mixing problem. Finally, the more carbon dioxide we put into the atmosphere, the more the water in this warmed-up atmosphere will appear in vapor form; and water vapor is the most effective greenhouse gas of all.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02Taken together, one quickly sees why all quantitative estimates of the most effective driver of global warming reported in the IPCC 2001 report identify carbon dioxide as the strongest contributor. To summarize, the extensively studied and well-known greenhouse effects of carbon dioxide are so strong that, combined with its persistence in our atmosphere, we can reasonably conclude that the increasing atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide from human activity is very likely the dominant driver of global warming, and the warming effects will probably become worse with time for several decades, even after the emission rate has subsided.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02There are other greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming. Methane is the most important of these, but nitrous oxides also contribute and their concentration is rapidly increasing. All these gases are well mixed and will remain in the atmosphere for many decades. Aerosols also play an important role in global warming, and the effect of most of them, especially the sulphates, is generally toward cooling, as we have learned from the effect of large volcanic eruptions. However, based on the best knowledge available today from a large scientific community, the net effect of all of the other contributors to global warming isn't comparable to the effect of the well-studied greenhouse gases, with anthropogenic carbon dioxide demonstrably the leading contributor.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02Any consideration of the political dimension of an issue that has the global character of this one demands that we grasp the extraordinary complexity of the political challenge. There is seldom an easy path to effective action, even if the arguments favoring it are compelling. There will usually be those passionately devoted to the opposite viewpoint, even if the real source of their position is to maintain the status quo. These opponents are often articulate, and some of them hold positions of great influence. That is one problem faced by those who would take decisive action to address global warming today.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02But there is another. As Paul Krugman reports in the August 5 issue of the New York Times, there exists "a sort of parallel intellectual universe" in the sciences. Back in 1978, neoconservative theorist Irving Kristol encouraged major corporations to direct their "philanthropic contributions to scholars and institutions who are likely to advocate preservation of a strong private sector." Thus conservative think tanks emerged, first in the area of economics and then in hard science-creating in Krugman's words, "a world of 'scholars' whose careers are based on toeing an ideological line, rather than on doing research that stands up to scrutiny by their peers." We see this clearly regarding the issue of global warming. Even though the scientific consensus is overwhelming, skeptical reports having the appearance of peerreviewed research have led large segments of the public, as well as national leaders, to believe that global warming is a controversial idea.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02I attended a presentation on the question of global warming at the Rayburn House Office Building in Washington, DC, in May 2002, shortly after the IPCC 2001 report became generally available. A booklet was passed out by its author, Dr. S. Fred Singer, bearing the title The Kyoto Protocol is Not Backed by Science. This booklet makes frequent reference to the IPCC 2001 report, which contains a graph of surface temperature versus time up to the year 2000 C.E. The booklet carries a similar temperature-time plot on page 30, but cuts it off in the 1980s, just before the most spectacular rise in the 1990s! In the caption to this latter plot it says:

Temperatures fell till about 1975, when there was a sudden jump, tied to changes in ocean circulation and other worldwide changes.

Until backed by serious research, such claims are unconfirmed speculations.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02One more feature of the booklet is worth noting. In a paragraph on page 10, which argues that temperature observations since 1979 are in dispute, there appears the sentence, "It is likely therefore that the surface data (from poorly distributed land stations and sparse ocean measurements) are contaminated by the local warming effects of 'urban heat islands' acting on weather station thermometers (HTCS, 13)" The HTCS is a book by the same author, not a refereed scientific paper. And if the most recent temperature measurements had been so badly compromised-a conclusion with which many distinguished observers would stoutly disagree-those made at earlier dates to which I refer for comparisons were certainly much worse. Most significant of all, the IPPC 2001 report, on page 106, carries the following summary of many scientists who have studied the urban heat island effect in detail and whose work appears in the refereed literature.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02Clearly the urban heat island effect is a real climate change in urban areas, but is not representative of larger areas. Extensive tests have shown that the urban heat island effects are no more than about 0.05 degrees Centigrade up to 1990 in the global temperature records used in this chapter to depict climate change.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02The reader is encouraged to compare the above two direct quotes. Hopefully policy makers will compare the things they are told in science-policy briefings with the published consensus of working scientists. There are, after all, good reasons why almost all scientists are convinced that the evidence strongly supports the position that significant global warming is occurring, that the recently measured rate of global surface temperature rise is cause for serious concern, and that anthropogenic greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide, are likely the chief drivers of the current disturbing mean global temperature rise.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02This leaves us with the challenge of finding some politically practicable way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But it is an awkward truth that when most U.S. senators were asked informally in 2000 if they would support the Kyoto Protocol should President George W. Bush send it to the Senate for ratification, the overwhelming majority, Democrats as well as Republicans, said they could not. (Since that time, some new terms have been included in the Protocol to facilitate the admission of China and India, so this situation may have changed.) The reason for the liberals' surprising reply is clear. Many studies, not all by conservatives, suggest that full compliance with the terms of the Kyoto Protocol would likely lead to a deep American recession. For those willing to run this risk, sober reflection on the consequences of the economic collapse of 1929 and the subsequent worldwide depression with all its political and ultimately military consequences is certainly in order.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02That said, what can be done, in particular by our own country? I have no new ideas for the solution, nor have I to date discovered any valid ones proposed by others. Nevertheless, in agreement with a large number of scientists who have given this issue considerable thought, there is one unambiguous statement I would make. Independent of the issues raised by the Kyoto Protocol, and given the weight of evidence that the problem of global warming is serious and fraught with dire consequences, failure to do anything at all and instead to promote "business as usual" is downright criminal.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02Yet I see little evidence that the Bush administration has given more than lip service to the problem, though that could be changing. It is one thing to weigh alternatives and implement compromises that reflect the complexity of the problem; it is quite another thing to do nothing, especially if doing nothing is just a way of securing support from certain industries that exacerbate the problem.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02There are, after all, things that can be done. Reopening a serious international dialogue, and not just saying a few good words, would be a useful if inadequate start. Not every problem must be solved before the weight of evidence becomes so compelling that certain initial steps become almost mandatory. We already know how to make more fuel-efficient automobiles, yet no national policy has surfaced to accomplish this. The scientific and engineering communities are the ones best suited to identify the scientific research that is still needed and the technical projects that show the greatest promise. These issues should be decided by them and not the politicians. Once solutions look promising, as a few already do, industry will be all too ready to jump in, for at that stage there is money to be made. And only a fool would underestimate human ingenuity when given a proper incentive, or the strength of American industry once the boiler is lit under it.

As for why this is so, research by thousands of scientists strongly suggests that the cause is the largely uncontrolled and still increasing release of anthropogenic (human-caused) greenhouse gases. Yet there remain a few scientists who oppose these conclusions, claiming that either the evidence for significant global warming is unreliable or that, granting the problem, the sources are natural cycles over which we have little or no control.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02This isn't a mere academic debate. The conclusions held by leaders in a variety of fields can't help but have a profound impact on social, political, and economic policy. Thus each side has expended considerable effort to convince the public, and through it the political establishment, of the validity of its stance. But because neither has been entirely successful, particularly in the United States, policies have been inconsistent and changeable, subject to partisan wrangling, corporate lobbying, and a general inadequacy of resolve.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02The importance of the issue was most forcefully brought to the publics attention with Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita. Their unusual severity, being among the strongest ever recorded in the Gulf of Mexico, reminded a number of network newscasters of recent scientific reports predicting an increase in hurricane severity.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02For example, the article "Extreme Weather: Is Global Warming to Blame?" in the May/June 2005 E/The Environmental Magazine quoted Ruth Curry, a Woods Hole Oceanographie Institute research specialist, saying, "Sea surface temperatures all over the tropics are running 1.8 to 3.6 degrees above normal. This is due to global warming." The article's author, Jennifer Vogel, noted the relevance of this: "While ocean and atmospheric circulation is the engine of a hurricane, heat is the fuel." Her summation makes it all plain: "The general scientific consensus on climate change and hurricanes is this: Hurricanes won't necessarily become more frequent, but they will become more intense."

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02This view was further supported by Massachusetts Institute of Technology climatologist Kerry Emanuel, writing in the July 2005 issue of Nature. He reported research suggesting that violent storms originating in the Atlantic and Pacific since 1970 have increased in intensity and duration by approximately 50 percent.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02But on August 2 the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration raised its 2005 Atlantic Ocean hurricane forecast, predicting eighteen to twenty-one tropical storms: nine to eleven of which would become hurricanes and between five and seven expected to reach major hurricane status. By October 9 the season had already yielded twenty tropical storms, eleven of which became hurricanes and five that were major. By contrast, a typical Atlantic storm year has only six hurricanes with two to three being major. That this is part of a new trend over recent years emerges from the NOAA's statement that "these very high levels of activity are comparable to those seen during August-November 2003 and 2004." The conclusion would seem to be that, with global warming, hurricanes are becoming not only more severe but also more frequent. And the mainstream media is paying attention.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02If the summarized results of thousands of scientific studies that appear in the Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Control-Climate Change 2001, The Scientific Study, hereafter referred to as the IPCC 2001 report, are valid, the answer is unambiguously that significant global warming is occurring. Yet there are still a few dissenters in the scientific community, albeit a small minority. As a result, it will be necessary to examine the evidence and the arguments on both sides.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02Climate scientists define global warming as the measured increase in the mean Earth surface temperature over a specified time interval. The most reliable data are properly averaged over land and ocean surfaces, statistically weighted according to the density of measurements within each equal-area element. The final averaging is done for the entire surface of the globe.

That is approximately one degree Fahrenheit. The warming hasn't been uniform over the globe, however. In general it has been greater over the land than the oceans and, probably for that reason, greater over the northern hemisphere than the southern. This isn't surprising given the greater thermal inertia of the oceans due to the high heat capacity of water. There is also some speculation that the greater industrial activity, hence greater greenhouse gas emission, in the northern hemisphere may have contributed. However, because the main greenhouse gases are well mixed-staying in the circulating atmosphere for a long time-this effect may be small or even negligible.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02Of particular concern is the rapid temperature rise over the last quarter of the twentieth century. The observations reviewed in the IPCC 2001 report show that the 1990s was the hottest decade on record and the year 1998 the hottest year since reliable temperature measurements were made. Reliable direct temperature measurements carry the record back into the erature measurements carry the record back into the nineteenth century. And with the use of well-established indirect methods, it has been maintained that this decade was probably the hottest over the last thousand years.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02One might think this weight of evidence for global warming is so overwhelming that the only remaining issue would be to establish the cause. However, a few additional issues need to be examined. While none of these suggest that global warming in the twentieth century didn't occur, there is still some controversy over the details of the rise. The curve of increasing surface temperature in the twentieth century shows a definite increase in the first part of the century, then an extended plateau over the years 1940 to 1975, and finally the rapid increase already discussed. Scientists ask why there were thirty-five years of no significant measured temperature rise during a mid-century period of increasing emission of anthropogenic greenhouse gases. Though industrial aerosol emissions that could have balanced the effect of the greenhouse gases were also increasing during this period, no satisfactory answer has yet emerged.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02There is another problem that involves climate modeling. The best current general circulation models have predicted that tropospheric temperatures at heights in the atmosphere of a few kilometers should track surface temperatures. But measurements show little warming at these tropospheric levels, in disagreement with the models. Current work at the Goddard Institute for Space Science suggests that the discrepancy might be corrected by a better treatment of still poorly understood aerosols, plus dynamical processes that connect the troposphere with higher-lying atmospheric layers, but a definitive explanation hasn't yet emerged.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02This is why it's important to always keep in mind that final answers to many important questions relating to global warming don't yet exist. Science isn't a collection of proved certainties: a factor often used as a reason for doing practically nothing, as if any action taken before all questions have been definitively answered is premature. But if the weight of evidence suggests a problem is both real and likely to become more serious with time, most reasonable people would say that doing nothing is the height of folly. Therefore, notwithstanding the aforementioned uncertainties, there remains the fact that an enormous body of well-calibrated observations supports the unambiguous rise in global surface temperature.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02Understanding the consensus of the scientific community, it remains necessary to ask if the likely harmful effects of global warming sufficiently outweigh the probable benefits of policies that might have harmful economic consequences. Furthermore, we need to ask about the likely positive effects of global warming? Might the news be good rather than bad?

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02There is some truth in this latter idea. Moderate global warming will enhance the agricultural productivity over parts of the globe. Climate models haven't advanced to the point of yielding accurate predictions of the detailed effects on all regional climates, but all of the more sophisticated models, in agreement with observations, predict that warming is greatest at the higher northern latitudes. Thus, for example, it seems probable that large areas of Russia and Canada could become more productive as the Earths surface warms, though this could be offset by insufficient regional rainfall, currently difficult to predict.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02In addition, increasing the growth rate of plants increases the rate at which the major greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, is removed from the atmosphere through photosynthesis, while the rate of beneficial oxygen released also increases. This has been confirmed experimentally in areas of new forest growth and annual agricultural production, which, because of the rapid growth rate of young plants, is more beneficial from the above standpoint than an old-growth forest where overall growth rates have greatly subsided.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02But are these benefits likely to significantly offset the known harmful effects of global warming? Let's review the negative consequences.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02Perhaps most disturbing is sea-level rise. Water expands with increasing temperature, causing the sea level to rise accordingly. The best evidence from observations gives a mean global sea-level rise over the twentieth century of at least one foot, corresponding to the approximately one-degree Fahrenheit mean global temperature rise. Many of the world's glaciers are also retreating and very few are growing. If greater warming should induce significant melting of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (anchored in the ocean below sea level) or, worse, a significant part of the Greenland Ice Cap, the rise in sea level could exceed twenty feet or more. The effect on major coastal cities, if warming continues, is likely to become significant by the end of the twenty-first century and will be disastrous or even catastrophic if the warming exceeds moderate increases of a few degrees Fahrenheit.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02There will be many other damaging effects of sealevel rise. The global ocean-circulation "conveyor belt" is known to be highly sensitive to temperature and salinity, resulting in so-called thermohaline circulation. Some observations suggest that the Gulf Stream, on which northwestern Europe is critically dependent, may be slowing down due to the reduced density of Arctic seawater. This water is becoming fresher from the more rapid melting of the Arctic Ice Sheet and is thus less density driven to sink into the deep ocean, providing a major driving force for the circulation at high northern latitudes. Sea-level rise will also flood many coastal wetlands critical to certain human activities and many forms of wildlife. While tough-minded "realists" may scoff at the importance of songbirds in the United States, they need to consider the role these birds play in controlling insect pests. Flooding the low-lying swamps of southern Louisiana will ensure a precipitous drop in the numbers of insectivorous migrating songbirds that are critically dependent on this area for food after their long spring migration back to North America.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02Many other damaging effects of global warming are known with near certainty. Warming increases the incidence of pathogens responsible for many human and animal diseases. Warming induces changes in weather patterns, with increasing evidence (as mentioned above) that we can expect more violent storms. Moreover, there has been a spate of recent, unusual weather extremes in Europe, from deadly heat waves (in which over 30,000 people died in 2003) to tumultuous rainstorms in southeastern Europe, to forest fires in Portugal, to drought throughout Iberia. And warming means that a smaller fraction of the Earths surface will be covered by snow and ice, which reflect sunlight more effectively than other land and sea surfaces. This increased absorption of sunlight sets in motion an unstable process that further enhances global warming.

For it is almost certain that the harmful effects will greatly outweigh the possible benefits, with many highly damaging effects already occurring.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02It is often noted by critics of the current consensus that many natural processes might contribute to global warming and that one or more of them may be the dominant driver or drivers. It is therefore necessary to look at this claim and see if it holds up.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02Examination of the mean global temperature curve for the northern hemisphere over the past millennium does reveal a fluctuating temperature of as much as 0.4 degrees Centigrade before the twentieth century. That is a sufficiently large fraction of the approximately 0.6 degree rise during the twentieth century to induce some scientists to speculate that even the recent rise, though unprecedented for the rate of change over this millennium, may have been caused by a long-period internal mode of the climate system, or by small longterm changes in the solar radiation.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02It is true that not all internal modes of the climate system are well understood. However, I am aware of no evidence for any mechanism of this kind that has been studied at length in the refereed literature and which appears likely to produce long-term global warming. Instead, this possibility remains an unsubstantiated if interesting speculation.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02This brings us to the sun, my primary area of expertise. A major effort has been underway in the National Aeronautic and Space Administration since 1979, and more recently in the European Space Agency, to obtain accurate measurements of the total solar irradiance (TSI), the flux of solar energy at the top of the Earth's atmosphere. One unambiguous result is that the TSI has varied by a small amount (no more than 0.1 percent) since 1979 over the well-known "eleven-year" solar cycle of sunspot activity. The TSI is measurably higher at solar maximum, when there are many sunspots, than at solar minimum, when there are few or none. However, this small increase in the solar flux, if simply "dumped" into the Earth's atmosphere as added heat, is insufficient to contribute to global warming. Furthermore, global warming doesn't exhibit a strong eleven-year cycle. Consequently, solar scientists have also looked for a change in the TSI over times longer than one eleven-year cycle. A recent increase should show up in the TSI measured at successive solar minima, when solar-cycle dependent processes that contribute to the TSI are largely absent. Unfortunately, the precision of the observations to date hasn't yielded a definitive result, though what evidence is available suggests there is either no change between minima or a very small change that, viewed as heat introduced into the Earths atmosphere, by itself couldn't explain the recent mean global temperature rise.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02One must note that there are further possibilities for solar influence involving the effect of solar ultraviolet radiation on our upper atmosphere, and also possible small long-term changes in the solar interplanetary magnetic field at Earth, which influences comic-ray penetration and could indirectly affect cloud formation. These are subjects of ongoing research. Notwithstanding these many efforts, no strong suggestion has emerged that any of the known solar influences are playing a major role as global warming drivers.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02The lack of a convincing argument based on solid research for any of the above hypotheses leads us to ask what we humans are doing that may be causing global warming. This leads naturally into an examination of anthropogenic greenhouse gases. Unlike the more speculative discussion of possible causes reviewed above, a very strong case can be made that carbon dioxide, in particular, is probably a significant driver, and could well be the dominant driver, of the current rapid rise in global mean surface temperatures.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02There is no disagreement over the occurrence of the greenhouse effect to which carbon dioxide contributes. If the relatively long-wavelength infrared radiation from the relatively cool (compared to the sun's emitting surface) Earth all escaped into space, the Earth would be approximately fifty degrees Fahrenheit cooler than it is. Therefore life as we know it is critically dependent on the greenhouse effect. The question becomes how much greenhouse effect is good for us. Carbon dioxide is a well-studied gas that readily absorbs Earth's infrared radiation and reradiates part of it back to the Earth, thus causing warming. We know that the concentration of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere has increased by more than 30 percent since the beginning of the industrial revolution and that this percentage is increasing rapidly today, especially as China and India industrialize. We also know that carbon dioxide is so well mixed in our atmosphere that once there it will remain for more than a century unless we actively remove it. Thus, to stabilize the concentration of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere and prevent ever more efficient greenhouse warming, we will need to reduce the emission of carbon dioxide well below current rates of production-unless some powerful new "sink" for removing the gas can be developed. Even doing that won't likely lead to a stable situation for several decades; this is because of the aforementioned mixing problem. Finally, the more carbon dioxide we put into the atmosphere, the more the water in this warmed-up atmosphere will appear in vapor form; and water vapor is the most effective greenhouse gas of all.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02Taken together, one quickly sees why all quantitative estimates of the most effective driver of global warming reported in the IPCC 2001 report identify carbon dioxide as the strongest contributor. To summarize, the extensively studied and well-known greenhouse effects of carbon dioxide are so strong that, combined with its persistence in our atmosphere, we can reasonably conclude that the increasing atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide from human activity is very likely the dominant driver of global warming, and the warming effects will probably become worse with time for several decades, even after the emission rate has subsided.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02There are other greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming. Methane is the most important of these, but nitrous oxides also contribute and their concentration is rapidly increasing. All these gases are well mixed and will remain in the atmosphere for many decades. Aerosols also play an important role in global warming, and the effect of most of them, especially the sulphates, is generally toward cooling, as we have learned from the effect of large volcanic eruptions. However, based on the best knowledge available today from a large scientific community, the net effect of all of the other contributors to global warming isn't comparable to the effect of the well-studied greenhouse gases, with anthropogenic carbon dioxide demonstrably the leading contributor.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02Any consideration of the political dimension of an issue that has the global character of this one demands that we grasp the extraordinary complexity of the political challenge. There is seldom an easy path to effective action, even if the arguments favoring it are compelling. There will usually be those passionately devoted to the opposite viewpoint, even if the real source of their position is to maintain the status quo. These opponents are often articulate, and some of them hold positions of great influence. That is one problem faced by those who would take decisive action to address global warming today.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02But there is another. As Paul Krugman reports in the August 5 issue of the New York Times, there exists "a sort of parallel intellectual universe" in the sciences. Back in 1978, neoconservative theorist Irving Kristol encouraged major corporations to direct their "philanthropic contributions to scholars and institutions who are likely to advocate preservation of a strong private sector." Thus conservative think tanks emerged, first in the area of economics and then in hard science-creating in Krugman's words, "a world of 'scholars' whose careers are based on toeing an ideological line, rather than on doing research that stands up to scrutiny by their peers." We see this clearly regarding the issue of global warming. Even though the scientific consensus is overwhelming, skeptical reports having the appearance of peerreviewed research have led large segments of the public, as well as national leaders, to believe that global warming is a controversial idea.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02I attended a presentation on the question of global warming at the Rayburn House Office Building in Washington, DC, in May 2002, shortly after the IPCC 2001 report became generally available. A booklet was passed out by its author, Dr. S. Fred Singer, bearing the title The Kyoto Protocol is Not Backed by Science. This booklet makes frequent reference to the IPCC 2001 report, which contains a graph of surface temperature versus time up to the year 2000 C.E. The booklet carries a similar temperature-time plot on page 30, but cuts it off in the 1980s, just before the most spectacular rise in the 1990s! In the caption to this latter plot it says:

Until backed by serious research, such claims are unconfirmed speculations.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02One more feature of the booklet is worth noting. In a paragraph on page 10, which argues that temperature observations since 1979 are in dispute, there appears the sentence, "It is likely therefore that the surface data (from poorly distributed land stations and sparse ocean measurements) are contaminated by the local warming effects of 'urban heat islands' acting on weather station thermometers (HTCS, 13)" The HTCS is a book by the same author, not a refereed scientific paper. And if the most recent temperature measurements had been so badly compromised-a conclusion with which many distinguished observers would stoutly disagree-those made at earlier dates to which I refer for comparisons were certainly much worse. Most significant of all, the IPPC 2001 report, on page 106, carries the following summary of many scientists who have studied the urban heat island effect in detail and whose work appears in the refereed literature.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02Clearly the urban heat island effect is a real climate change in urban areas, but is not representative of larger areas. Extensive tests have shown that the urban heat island effects are no more than about 0.05 degrees Centigrade up to 1990 in the global temperature records used in this chapter to depict climate change.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02The reader is encouraged to compare the above two direct quotes. Hopefully policy makers will compare the things they are told in science-policy briefings with the published consensus of working scientists. There are, after all, good reasons why almost all scientists are convinced that the evidence strongly supports the position that significant global warming is occurring, that the recently measured rate of global surface temperature rise is cause for serious concern, and that anthropogenic greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide, are likely the chief drivers of the current disturbing mean global temperature rise.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02This leaves us with the challenge of finding some politically practicable way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But it is an awkward truth that when most U.S. senators were asked informally in 2000 if they would support the Kyoto Protocol should President George W. Bush send it to the Senate for ratification, the overwhelming majority, Democrats as well as Republicans, said they could not. (Since that time, some new terms have been included in the Protocol to facilitate the admission of China and India, so this situation may have changed.) The reason for the liberals' surprising reply is clear. Many studies, not all by conservatives, suggest that full compliance with the terms of the Kyoto Protocol would likely lead to a deep American recession. For those willing to run this risk, sober reflection on the consequences of the economic collapse of 1929 and the subsequent worldwide depression with all its political and ultimately military consequences is certainly in order.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02That said, what can be done, in particular by our own country? I have no new ideas for the solution, nor have I to date discovered any valid ones proposed by others. Nevertheless, in agreement with a large number of scientists who have given this issue considerable thought, there is one unambiguous statement I would make. Independent of the issues raised by the Kyoto Protocol, and given the weight of evidence that the problem of global warming is serious and fraught with dire consequences, failure to do anything at all and instead to promote "business as usual" is downright criminal.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02Yet I see little evidence that the Bush administration has given more than lip service to the problem, though that could be changing. It is one thing to weigh alternatives and implement compromises that reflect the complexity of the problem; it is quite another thing to do nothing, especially if doing nothing is just a way of securing support from certain industries that exacerbate the problem.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02There are, after all, things that can be done. Reopening a serious international dialogue, and not just saying a few good words, would be a useful if inadequate start. Not every problem must be solved before the weight of evidence becomes so compelling that certain initial steps become almost mandatory. We already know how to make more fuel-efficient automobiles, yet no national policy has surfaced to accomplish this. The scientific and engineering communities are the ones best suited to identify the scientific research that is still needed and the technical projects that show the greatest promise. These issues should be decided by them and not the politicians. Once solutions look promising, as a few already do, industry will be all too ready to jump in, for at that stage there is money to be made. And only a fool would underestimate human ingenuity when given a proper incentive, or the strength of American industry once the boiler is lit under it.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02Is Earth warming? The planet has warmed since the mid-1800s, but before that it cooled for more than five centuries. Cycles of warming and cooling have been part of Earth's natural climate history for millions of years. So what is the global warming debate about? It's about the proposition that human use of fossil fuels has contributed significantly to the past century's warming, and that expected future warming may have catastrophic global consequences. But hard evidence for this human contribution simply does not exist; the evidence we have is suggestive at best. Does that mean the human effects are not occurring? Not necessarily. But media coverage of global warming has been so alarmist that it fails to convey how flimsy the evidence really is. Most people don't realize that many strong statements about a human contribution to global warming are based more on politics than on science. Indeed, the climate change issue has become so highly politicized that its scientific and political aspects are now almost indistinguishable. The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), upon which governments everywhere have depended for the best scientific information, has been transformed from a bona fide effort in international scientific cooperation into what one of its leading participants terms "a hybrid scientific/political organization."

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02Yet apart from the overheated politics, climate change remains a fascinating and important scientific subject. Climate dynamics and climate history are extraordinarily complex, and despite intensive study for decades, scientists are not yet able to explain satisfactorily such basic phenomena as extreme weather events (hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts), El Nino variations, historical climate cycles, and trends of atmospheric temperatures. The scientific uncertainties about all these matters are great, and not surprisingly, competent scientists disagree in their interpretations of what is and is not known. In the current politicized atmosphere, however, legitimate scientific differences about climate change have been lost in the noise of politics.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02For some, global warming has become the ultimate symbol of pessimism about the environmental future. Writer Bill McKibben, for example, says, "If we had to pick one problem to obsess about over the next 50 years, we'd do well to make it carbon dioxide." I believe that we'd be far wiser to obsess about poverty than about carbon dioxide.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02Fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas) are the major culprits of the global warming controversy and happen also to be the principal energy sources for both rich and poor countries. Governments of the industrial countries have generally accepted the position, promoted by the IPCC, that humankind's use of fossil fuels is a major contributor to global warming, and in 1997 they forged an international agreement (the Kyoto Climate Change Protocol) mandating that worldwide fossil fuel use be drastically reduced as a precaution against future warming. In contrast, the developing nations for the most part do not accept global warming as a high-priority issue and, as yet, are not subject to the Kyoto agreement. Thus, the affluent nations and the developing nations have set themselves on a collision course over environmental policy relating to fossil fuel use.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02The debate about global warming focuses on carbon dioxide, a gas emitted into the atmosphere when fossil fuels are burned. Environmentalists generally label carbon dioxide as a pollutant; the Sierra Club, for example, in referring to carbon dioxide, states that "we are choking our planet in a cloud of this pollution." But to introduce the term pollution in this context is misleading because carbon dioxide is neither scientifically nor legally considered a pollutant. Though present in Earth's atmosphere in small amounts, carbon dioxide plays an essential role in maintaining life and as part of Earth's temperature control system.IMAGE ILLUSTRATIONThose who have had the pleasure of an elementary chemistry course will recall that carbon dioxide is one of the two main products of the combustion in air of any fossil fuel, the other being water. These products are generally emitted into the atmosphere, no matter whether the combustion takes place in power plants, household gas stoves and heaters, manufacturing facilities, automobiles, or other sources. The core scientific issue of the global warming debate is the extent to which atmospheric carbon dioxide from fossil fuel burning affects global climate.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02When residing in the atmosphere, carbon dioxide and water vapor are called "greenhouse gases," so named because they trap some of Earth's heat in the same way that the glass canopy of a greenhouse prevents some of its internal heat from escaping, thereby warming the interior of the greenhouse. By this type of heating, greenhouse gases occurring naturally in the atmosphere perform a critical function. In fact, without greenhouse gases Earth would be too cold, all water on the planet would be frozen, and life as we know it would never have developed. In addition to its role in greenhouse warming, carbon dioxide is essential for plant physiology; without it, all plant life would die.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02A number of greenhouse gases other than carbon dioxide and water vapor occur naturally in Earth's atmosphere and have been there for millennia. What's new is that during the industrial era, humankind's burning of fossil fuels has been adding carbon dioxide to the atmospheric mix of greenhouse gases over and above the amounts naturally present. The preindustrial level of 287 parts per million (ppm) of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased almost 30 percent, to 367 ppm (as of 1998).

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02Few, if any, scientists question the measurements showing that atmospheric carbon dioxide has increased by almost a third. Nor do most scientists question that humans are the cause of most or all of the carbon dioxide increase. Yet the media continually point to these two facts as the major evidence that humans are causing the global warming Earth has recently experienced. The weak link in this argument is that empirical science has not established an unambiguous connection between the carbon dioxide increase and the observed global warming. The real scientific controversy about global warming is not about the presence of additional carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from human activities, which is well established, but about the extent to which that additional carbon dioxide affects climate, now or in the future.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02Earth's climate is constantly changing from natural causes that, for the most part, are not understood. How are we to distinguish the human contribution, which may be very small, from the natural contribution, which may be small or large? Put another way, is the additional carbon dioxide humans are adding to the atmosphere likely to have a measurable effect on global temperature, which is in any case changing continually from natural causes? Or is the temperature effect from the additional carbon dioxide likely to be imperceptible, and therefore unimportant as a practical matter?

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02Global warming is not something that happened only recently. In Earth's long history, climate change is the rule rather than the exception, and studies of Earth's temperature record going back a million years clearly reveal a number of climate cycles-warming and cooling trends. Their causes are multiple-possibly including periodic changes in solar output and variations in Earth's tilt and orbit-but poorly understood. In recent times, Earth entered a warming period. From thermometer records, we know that the air at Earth's surface warmed about 0.6[degrees]C over the period from the 1860s to the present. The observed warming, however, does not correlate well with the growth in fossil fuel use during that period. About half of the observed warming took place before 1940, though it was only after 1940 that the amounts of greenhouse gases produced by fossil fuel burning rose rapidly, as a result of the heavy industrial expansions of World War II and the postwar boom (80 percent of the carbon dioxide from human activities was added to the air after 1940).

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02Surprisingly, from about 1940 until about 1980, during a period of rapid increase in fossil fuel burning, global surface temperatures actually displayed a slight cooling trend rather than an acceleration of the warming trend that would have been expected from greenhouse gases. During the 1970s some scientists even became concerned about the possibility of a new ice age from an extended period of global cooling (a report of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences reflected that concern). Physicist Freeman Dyson notes that "the onset of the next ice age [would be] a far more severe catastrophe than anything associated with warming."

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02Earth's cooling trend did not continue beyond 1980, but neither has there been an unambiguous warming trend. Since 1980, precise temperature measurements have been made in Earth's atmosphere and on its surface, but the results do not agree. The surface air measurements indicate significant warming (0.25 to 0.4[degrees]C), but the atmospheric measurements show very little, if any, warming.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02Briefly, then, the record is this: From 1860 to 1940, Earth's surface warmed about 0.4[degrees]C. Then Earth's surface cooled about 0.1[degrees]C in the first four decades after 1940 and warmed about 0.3[degrees]C in the next two. For those two most recent decades, temperature measurements of the atmosphere have also been available, and, while these measurements are subject to significant uncertainty, they indicate that the atmosphere's temperature has remained essentially unchanged. Thus, the actual temperature record does not support the claims widely found in environmental literature and the media that Earth has been steadily warming over the past century. (A new study that may shed more light on this question - one of a number sure to come - has been circulated but is being revised and has not yet been published.)

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02For the probable disparity between the surface and atmospheric temperature trends of the past 20 years, several explanations have been offered. The first is that large urban centers create artificial heating zones - "heat islands" - that can contribute to an increase of surface temperature (though one analysis concludes that the heat island effect is too small to explain the discrepancy fully). The second explanation is that soot and dust from volcanic eruptions may have contributed to cooling of the atmosphere by blocking the Sun's heat (though this cooling should have affected both surface and atmospheric temperatures). In the United States, despite the presence of large urban areas, surface cooling after 1930 far exceeded that of Earth as a whole, and the surface temperature has subsequently warmed only to the level of the 1930s.IMAGE GRAPHWide fluctuations in surface temperatures have been the norm in Earth's history. These estimates are derived from oxygen-isotope ratios in fossilized plankton from the ocean floor.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02It's frequently claimed that the recent increases in surface temperature are uniquely hazardous to Earth's ecosystems because of the rapidity with which they are occurring-more than 0.1[degrees]C in a decade. That may be true, but some past climate changes were rapid as well. For example, around 14,700 years ago, temperatures in Greenland apparently jumped 5[degrees]C in less than 20 years-almost three times the warming from greenhouse gases predicted to occur in this entire century by the most pessimistic scientists.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02Whatever the current rate of surface warming, there is little justification for the view that Earth's climate should be unchanging, and that any climate change now occurring must have been caused by humans and should therefore be fixed by humans. In fact, as noted earlier, changing climate patterns and cycles have occurred throughout Earth's history. For millions of years, ice sheets regularly waxed and waned as global heating and cooling processes took place. During the most recent ice age, some 50,000 years ago, ice sheets covered much of North America, northern Europe, and northern Asia. About 12,000 years ago a warming trend began, signaling the start of an interglacial period that continues to this day. This warm period may have peaked 5,000 to 6,000 years ago, when global ice melting accelerated and global temperatures became higher than today's. Interglacial periods are thought to persist for about 10,000 years, so the next ice age may be coming soon-that is, in 500 to 1,000 years.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02Within the current interglacial period, smaller cyclic patterns have emerged. In the most recent millennium, several cycles occurred during which Earth alternately warmed and cooled. There's evidence for an unusually warm period over at least parts of the globe from the end of the first millennium to about 1300. A mild climate in the Northern Hemisphere during those centuries probably facilitated the migration of Scandinavian peoples to Greenland and Iceland, as well as their first landing on the North American continent, just after 1000. The settlements in Greenland and Iceland thrived for several hundred years but eventually were abandoned when the climate turned colder, after about 1450. The cold period, which lasted until the late 1800s, is often called the Little Ice Age. Agricultural productivity fell, and the mass exodus to North America of many Europeans is attributed at least in part to catastrophic crop failures such as the potato famine in Ireland.IMAGE GRAPHScientists know that mean global surface air temperatures have been rising for a century, but they don't know for certain why-nor why temperatures fell between 1940 and 1980.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02A plausible interpretation of most or all of the observed surface warming over the past century is that Earth is in the process of coming out of the Little Ice Age cold cycle that began 600 years ago. The current warming trend could last for centuries, until the expected arrival of the next ice age, or it could be punctuated by transient warm and cold periods, as were experienced in the recent millennium.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02A great deal of global warming rhetoric gives the impression that science has established beyond doubt that the recent warming is mostly due to human activities. But that has not been established. Though human use of fossil fuels might contribute to global warming in the future, there's no hard scientific evidence that it is already doing so, and the difficulty of establishing a human contribution by empirical observation is formidable. One would need to detect a very small amount of warming caused by human activity in the presence of a much larger background of naturally occurring climate change-a search for the proverbial needle in a haystack.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02Still, understanding climate change is by no means beyond science's reach, and research is proceeding in several complementary ways. Paleoclimatologists have been probing Earth's past climatic changes and are uncovering exciting new information about Earth's climate history going back thousands, and even millions, of years. This paleohistory will help eventually to produce a definitive picture of Earth's evolving climate, and help in turn to clarify the climate changes we're experiencing in our own era. But we are far from knowing enough to be able to predict what the future may hold for Earth's climate.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02Mindful of the limited empirical knowledge about climate, some climate scientists have been attempting to understand possible future changes by using computer modeling techniques. By running several scenarios, the modelers obtain a set of theoretical projections of how global temperature might change in the future in response to assumed inputs, governed mainly by the levels of fossil fuel use. But like all computer modeling, even state-of-the-art climate modeling has significant limitations. For example, the current models cannot simulate the natural variability of climate over centurylong time periods. A further major shortcoming is that they project only gradual climate change, whereas the most serious impacts of climate change could come about from abrupt changes. (A simple analogy is to the abrupt formation of frost, causing leaf damage and plant death, when the ambient air temperature gradually dips below the freezing point.) Given the shortcomings, policymakers should exercise considerable caution in using current climate models as quantitative indicators of future global warming.IMAGE ILLUSTRATIONScientists have long been aware that physical factors other than greenhouse gases can influence atmospheric temperature. Among the most important are aerosols-tiny particles (sulfates, black carbon, organic compounds, and so forth) introduced into the atmosphere by a variety of pollution sources, including automobiles and coal-burning electricity generators, as well as by natural sources such as sea spray and desert dust. Some aerosols, such as black carbon, normally contribute to heating of the atmosphere because they absorb the Sun's heat (though black carbon aerosols residing at high altitudes can actually cool Earth's surface because they block the Sun's rays from getting through to it). Other aerosols, composed of sulfates and organic compounds, cool the atmosphere because they reflect or scatter the Sun's rays away from Earth. Current evidence indicates that aerosols may be responsible for cooling effects at Earth's surface and warming effects in Earth's atmosphere. But the impacts of pollution on Earth's climate are very uncertain. The factors involved are difficult to simulate, but they must be included in computer models if the models are to be useful indicators of future climate. When climate models are finally able to incorporate the full complexity of pollution effects, especially from aerosols, the projected global temperature change could be either higher or lower than current projections, depending on the chemistry, altitude, and geographic region of the particular aerosols involved. Or, it could even be zero.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02In addition to pollution, other physical factors that can influence surface and atmospheric temperature are methane (another greenhouse gas), dust from volcanic activity, and changes in cloud cover, ocean circulation patterns, air-sea interactions, and the Sun's energy output. "The forcings that drive long-term climate change," concludes James Hansen, one of the pioneers of climate change science, "are not known with an accuracy sufficient to define future climate change. Anthropogenic greenhouse gases, which are well measured, cause a strong positive forcing [warming]. But other, poorly measured, anthropogenic forcings, especially changes of atmospheric aerosols, clouds, and land-use patterns, cause a negative forcing that tends to offset greenhouse warming." And as if the physical factors were not challenging enough, the inherent complexity of the climate system will always be present to thwart attempts to predict future climate.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02In view of climate's complexity and the limitations of today's climate simulations, one might expect that pronouncements as to human culpability for climate change would be made with considerable circumspection, especially pronouncements made in the name of the scientific community. So it was disturbing to many scientists that a summary report of the IPCC issued in 1996 contained the assertion that "the balance of evidence suggests a discernible climate change due to human activities." The latest IPCC report (2001) goes even further, claiming that "there is new and stronger evidence that most of the warming observed over the last 50 years is attributable to human activities." But most of this evidence comes from new computer simulations and does not satisfactorily address either the disparity in the empirical temperature record between surface and atmosphere or the large uncertainties in the contributions of aerosols and other factors. A report issued by the National Academy of Sciences in 2001 says this about the model simulations:

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02Because of the large and still uncertain level of natural variability inherent in the climate record and the uncertainties in the time histories of the various forcing agents (and presumably aerosols), a causal linkage between the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and the observed climate changes during the 20th century cannot be unequivocally established. The fact that the magnitude of the observed warming is large in comparison to natural variability as simulated in climate models is suggestive of such a linkage, but it does not constitute proof of one because the model simulations could be deficient in natural variability on the decadal to century time scale.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02These IPCC reports have been adopted as the centerpiece of most current popularizations of global warming in the media and in the environmental literature, and their political impact has been enormous. The 1996 report was the principal basis for government climate policy in most industrial countries, including the United States. The IPCC advised in the report that drastic reductions in the burning of fossil fuels would be required to avoid a disastrous global temperature increase. That advice was the driving force behind the adoption in 1997 of the Kyoto protocol to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in the near future.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02In its original form, the protocol had many flaws. First, it exempted developing countries, including China, India, and Brazil, from the emission cutbacks; such countries are increasingly dependent on fossil fuels, and their current greenhouse gas emissions already exceed those of the developed countries. Second, it mandated short-term reductions in fossil fuel use to reach the emission targets without regard to the costs of achieving those targets. Forced cutbacks in fossil fuel use could have severe economic consequences for industrial countries (the protocol would require the United States to cut back its fossil fuel combustion by over 30 percent to reach the targeted reduction of carbon dioxide emissions by 2010), and even greater consequences for poor countries should they ultimately agree to be included in the emissions targets. The costs of the cutbacks would have to be paid up front, whereas the assumed benefits would come only many decades later. Third, the fossil fuel cutbacks mandated by the protocol are too small to be effective-averting, by one estimate, only 0.06[degrees]C of global warming by 2050.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02The Kyoto protocol was signed in 1997 by many industrial countries, including the United States, but to have legal status, it must be ratified by nations that together account for 55 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. As of June 2002, the protocol had been ratified by 73 countries, including Japan and all 15 nations of the European Union. These countries are responsible, in all, for only 36 percent of emissions, but the 55 percent requirement may be met by Russia's expected ratification. Nonetheless, the treaty is unlikely to have real force without ratification by the United States. The Bush administration opposes the treaty, on the grounds of its likely negative economic impact on America, and has thus far not sought Senate ratification. Even the Clinton administration did not seek ratification, despite its having signed the initial protocol, because it was aware that the U.S. Senate had unanimously adopted a resolution rejecting in principle any climate change treaty that does not include meaningful participation by developing countries.

A study by economist William Nordhaus in Science magazine (Nov. 9, 2001) finds that a Kyoto treaty modified along these lines would incur substantial costs, bring little progress toward its objective, and, because of the huge fund transfers that would result from the practice of emissions trading, stir political disputes. Nordhaus concludes that participation in the treaty would have cost the United States some $2.3 trillion over the coining decades-more than twice the combined cost to all other participants. It does not require sympathy with overall U.S. climate change policy to understand the nation's reluctance to be so unequal a partner in the Kyoto enterprise.

But regardless of the causes, we do know that Earth's surface has warmed during the past century. Although we don't know the extent to which it will warm in the future, or whether it will warm at all, we can't help but ask a couple of critical questions: How much does global warming matter? What would be the consequences if the global average temperature did actually rise during the current century by, say, some 2[degrees]C?

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02Some environmentalists have predicted dire consequences from the warming, including extremes of weather, the loss of agricultural productivity, a destructive rise in sea level, and the spread of diseases. Activists press for international commitments much stronger than the Kyoto protocol to reduce the combustion of fossil fuels, and they justify the measures as precautionary. Others counter that the social and economic impacts of forced reductions in fossil fuel use would be more serious than the effects of a temperature rise, which could be small, or even beneficial.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02Although the debate over human impacts on climate probably won't be resolved for decades, a case can be made for adopting a less alarmist view of a warmer world. In any event, the warmer world is already here. In the past 2,500 years, global temperatures have varied by more than 3[degrees]C, and some of the changes have been much more abrupt than the gradual changes projected by the IPCC. During all of recorded history, humans have survived and prospered in climate zones far more different from one another than those that might result from the changes in global temperatures now being discussed.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02Those who predict agricultural losses from a warmer climate have most likely got it backwards. Warm periods have historically benefited the development of civilization, and cold periods have been detrimental. For example, the Medieval Warm Period, from about 900 to 1300, facilitated the Viking settlement of Iceland and Greenland, whereas the subsequent Little Ice Age led to crop failures, famines, and disease. Even a small temperature increase brings a longer and more frost-free growing season-an advantage for many farmers, especially those in large, cold countries such as Russia and Canada. Agronomists know that the enrichment of atmospheric carbon dioxide stimulates plant growth and development in greenhouses; such enrichment at the global level might be expected to increase vegetative and biological productivity and water-use efficiency. Studies of the issue from an economic perspective have reached the same conclusion: that moderate global warming would most likely produce net economic benefits, especially for the agriculture and forestry sectors. Of course, such projections are subject to great uncertainty and cannot exclude the possibility that unexpected negative impacts would occur.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02As for the concern that warmer temperatures would spread insect-borne diseases such as malaria, dengue fever, and yellow fever, there's no solid evidence to support it. Although the spread of disease is a complex matter, the main carriers of these diseases-which were common in North America, western Europe, and Russia during the 19th century, when the world was colder than it is today-are most likely humans traveling the globe and insects traveling with people and goods. The strongest ally against future disease is surely not a cold climate but concerted improvement in regional insect control, water quality, and public health. As poverty recedes and people's living conditions improve in the developing world, the level of disease, and its spread, can be expected to decrease. Paul Reiter, a specialist in insect-borne diseases, puts it this way:

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02Insect-borne diseases are not diseases of climate but of poverty. Whatever the climate, developing countries will remain at risk until they acquire window screens, air conditioning, modern medicine, and other amenities most Americans take for granted. As a matter of social policy, the best precaution is to improve living standards in general and health infrastructures in particular.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02One of the direst (and most highly publicized) predictions of global warming theorists is that greenhouse gas warming will cause sea level to rise and that, as a result, many oceanic islands and lowland areas, such as Bangladesh, may be submerged. But in fact, sea level-which once was low enough to expose a land bridge between Siberia and Alaskais rising now, and has been rising for thousands of years. Recent analyses suggest that sea level rose at a rate of about one to two centimeters per century (0.4 to 0.8 inch) over the past 3,000 years. Some studies have interpreted direct sea-level measurements made throughout the 20th century to show that the level is now rising at a much faster rate, about 10 to 25 centimeters per century (4 to 10 inches), but other studies conclude that the rate is much lower than that. To whatever extent sea-level rise may have accelerated, the change is thought to have taken place before the period of industrialization.IMAGE ILLUSTRATIONBefore considering whether the ongoing sea-level rise has anything to do with human use of fossil fuels, let's examine what science has to say about how global temperature change may relate to sea-level change. The matter is more complicated than it first appears. Water expands as it warms, which would contribute to rising sea level. But warming increases the evaporation of ocean water, which could increase the snowfall on the Arctic and Antarctic ice sheets, remove water from the ocean, and lower sea level. The relative importance of these two factors is not known.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02We do know from studies of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet that it has been melting continuously since the last great ice age, about 20,000 years ago, and that sea level has been rising ever since. Continued melting of the ice sheet until the next ice age may be inevitable, in which case sea level would rise by 15 to 18 feet when the sheet was completely melted. Other mechanisms have been suggested for natural sea-level rise, including tectonic changes in the shape of the ocean basins. The theoretical computer climate models attribute most of the sea-level rise to thermal expansion of the oceans, and thus they predict that further global temperature increase (presumably from human activities) will accelerate the sea-level rise. But because these models cannot deal adequately with the totality of the natural phenomena involved, their predictions about sea-level rise should be viewed skeptically.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02The natural causes of sea-level rise are part of Earth's evolution. They have nothing to do with human activities, and there's nothing that humans can do about them. Civilization has always adjusted to such changes, just as it has adjusted to earthquakes and other natural phenomena. This is not to say that adjusting to natural changes is not sometimes painful, but if there's nothing we can do about certain natural phenomena, we do adjust to them, however painfully. Sea-level rise is, most likely, one of those phenomena over which humans have no control.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02Some environmentalists claim that weather-related natural disasters have been increasing in frequency and severity, presumably as a result of human-caused global warming, but the record does not support their claims. On the contrary, several recent statistical studies have found that natural disasters-hurricanes, typhoons, tropical storms, floods, blizzards, wildfires, heat waves, and earthquakes-are not on the increase. The costs of losses from natural disasters are indeed rising, to the dismay of insurance companies and government emergency agencies, but that's because people in affluent societies construct expensive properties in places vulnerable to natural hazards, such as coastlines, steep hills, and forested areas.IMAGE ILLUSTRATIONBecause society has choices, we must ask what the likely effects would be, on the one hand, if people decided to adjust to climate change, regardless of its causes, and, on the other, if governments implemented drastic policies to attempt to lessen the presumed human contribution to the change. From an economic perspective at least, adjusting to the change would almost surely come out ahead. Several analyses have projected that the overall cost of the worst-case consequences of warming would be no more than about a two percent reduction in world output. Given that average per capita income will probably quadruple during the next century, the potential loss seems small indeed. A recent economic study emphasizing adaptation to climate change indicates that in the market economy of the United States the overall impacts of modest global warming are even likely to be beneficial rather than damaging, though the amount of net benefit would be small, about 0.2 percent of the economy. (We need always to keep in mind the statistical uncertainties inherent in such analyses; there are small probabilities that the benefits or costs could turn out to be much greater than or much less than the most probable outcomes.)

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02In contrast, the economic costs of governmental actions restricting the use of fossil fuels could be large indeed, as suggested by the Nordhaus study cited earlier on the costs of compliance with the Kyoto treaty. One U.S. government study proposed that a cost-effective way of bringing about fossil fuel reductions would be a combination of carbon taxes and international trading in emissions rights. Emissions rights trading was, in fact, included in the modified Kyoto agreement. But such a trading scheme would result in huge income transfers, as rich nations paid poor nations for emissions quotas that the latter would probably not have used anyway-and it's not reasonable to assume that rich nations would be willing to do this.

The costs would be considerably higher if large reductions were forced upon the global economy over a short time period, or if, as is likely, the most economically efficient schemes to bring about the reductions were not actually employed. Political economists Henry Jacoby, Ronald Prinn, and Richard Schmalensee put the matter bluntly: "It will be nearly impossible to slow climate warming appreciably without condemning much of the world to poverty, unless energy sources that emit little or no carbon dioxide become competitive with conventional fossil fuels."

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02Some global warming has been under way for more than a century, at least partly from natural causes, and the world has been adjusting to it as it did to earlier climate changes. If human activity is finally judged to be adding to the natural warming, the amount of the addition is probably small, and society can adjust to that as well, at relatively low cost or even net benefit. But the industrial nations are not likely to carry out inefficient, Kyoto-type mandated reductions in fossil fuel use on the basis of so incomplete a scientific foundation as currently exists. The costs of so doing could well exceed the potential benefits. Far more effective would be policies and actions by the industrial countries to accelerate the development, in the near term, of technologies that utilize fossil fuels (and all resources) more efficiently and, in the longer term, of technologies that do not require the use of fossil fuels.

The affluent nations should support research programs that improve the theoretical understanding of climate change, build an empirical database about factors that influence long-term climate change, and increase our understanding of short-term weather dynamics. Such research is fundamental to the greenhouse gas issue. But its rewards may be greater still, for it will also improve our ability to cope with extreme weather events such as hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods, whatever their causes.SIDEBARTHE ACTUAL TEMPERATURE RECORD DOES NOT SUPPORT THE CLAIMS THAT EARTH HAS BEEN STEADILY WARMING OVER THE PAST CENTURY.SIDEBARPOLICYMAKERS SHOULD EXERCISE CONSIDERABLE CAUTION IN USING CURRENT CLIMATE MODELS AS QUANTITATIVE INDICATORS OF FUTURE GLOBAL WARMING.SIDEBARWHAT WOULD BE THE CONSEQUENCES IF THE GLOBAL AVERAGE TEMPERATURE ROSE DURING THE CURRENT CENTURY BY SOME TWO DEGREES CENTIGRADE?SIDEBAREVEN A SMALL TEMPERATURE INCREASE BRINGS A LONGER AND MORE FROST-FREE GROWING SEASON-AN ADVANTAGE FOR MANY FARMERS.AUTHOR_AFFILIATION&lt;JACK M.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02Is Earth warming? The planet has warmed since the mid-1800s, but before that it cooled for more than five centuries. Cycles of warming and cooling have been part of Earth's natural climate history for millions of years. So what is the global warming debate about? It's about the proposition that human use of fossil fuels has contributed significantly to the past century's warming, and that expected future warming may have catastrophic global consequences. But hard evidence for this human contribution simply does not exist; the evidence we have is suggestive at best. Does that mean the human effects are not occurring? Not necessarily. But media coverage of global warming has been so alarmist that it fails to convey how flimsy the evidence really is. Most people don't realize that many strong statements about a human contribution to global warming are based more on politics than on science. Indeed, the climate change issue has become so highly politicized that its scientific and political aspects are now almost indistinguishable. The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), upon which governments everywhere have depended for the best scientific information, has been transformed from a bona fide effort in international scientific cooperation into what one of its leading participants terms "a hybrid scientific/political organization."

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02Yet apart from the overheated politics, climate change remains a fascinating and important scientific subject. Climate dynamics and climate history are extraordinarily complex, and despite intensive study for decades, scientists are not yet able to explain satisfactorily such basic phenomena as extreme weather events (hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts), El Nino variations, historical climate cycles, and trends of atmospheric temperatures. The scientific uncertainties about all these matters are great, and not surprisingly, competent scientists disagree in their interpretations of what is and is not known. In the current politicized atmosphere, however, legitimate scientific differences about climate change have been lost in the noise of politics.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02For some, global warming has become the ultimate symbol of pessimism about the environmental future. Writer Bill McKibben, for example, says, "If we had to pick one problem to obsess about over the next 50 years, we'd do well to make it carbon dioxide." I believe that we'd be far wiser to obsess about poverty than about carbon dioxide.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02Fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas) are the major culprits of the global warming controversy and happen also to be the principal energy sources for both rich and poor countries. Governments of the industrial countries have generally accepted the position, promoted by the IPCC, that humankind's use of fossil fuels is a major contributor to global warming, and in 1997 they forged an international agreement (the Kyoto Climate Change Protocol) mandating that worldwide fossil fuel use be drastically reduced as a precaution against future warming. In contrast, the developing nations for the most part do not accept global warming as a high-priority issue and, as yet, are not subject to the Kyoto agreement. Thus, the affluent nations and the developing nations have set themselves on a collision course over environmental policy relating to fossil fuel use.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02The debate about global warming focuses on carbon dioxide, a gas emitted into the atmosphere when fossil fuels are burned. Environmentalists generally label carbon dioxide as a pollutant; the Sierra Club, for example, in referring to carbon dioxide, states that "we are choking our planet in a cloud of this pollution." But to introduce the term pollution in this context is misleading because carbon dioxide is neither scientifically nor legally considered a pollutant. Though present in Earth's atmosphere in small amounts, carbon dioxide plays an essential role in maintaining life and as part of Earth's temperature control system.IMAGE ILLUSTRATIONThose who have had the pleasure of an elementary chemistry course will recall that carbon dioxide is one of the two main products of the combustion in air of any fossil fuel, the other being water. These products are generally emitted into the atmosphere, no matter whether the combustion takes place in power plants, household gas stoves and heaters, manufacturing facilities, automobiles, or other sources. The core scientific issue of the global warming debate is the extent to which atmospheric carbon dioxide from fossil fuel burning affects global climate.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02When residing in the atmosphere, carbon dioxide and water vapor are called "greenhouse gases," so named because they trap some of Earth's heat in the same way that the glass canopy of a greenhouse prevents some of its internal heat from escaping, thereby warming the interior of the greenhouse. By this type of heating, greenhouse gases occurring naturally in the atmosphere perform a critical function. In fact, without greenhouse gases Earth would be too cold, all water on the planet would be frozen, and life as we know it would never have developed. In addition to its role in greenhouse warming, carbon dioxide is essential for plant physiology; without it, all plant life would die.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02A number of greenhouse gases other than carbon dioxide and water vapor occur naturally in Earth's atmosphere and have been there for millennia. What's new is that during the industrial era, humankind's burning of fossil fuels has been adding carbon dioxide to the atmospheric mix of greenhouse gases over and above the amounts naturally present. The preindustrial level of 287 parts per million (ppm) of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased almost 30 percent, to 367 ppm (as of 1998).

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02Few, if any, scientists question the measurements showing that atmospheric carbon dioxide has increased by almost a third. Nor do most scientists question that humans are the cause of most or all of the carbon dioxide increase. Yet the media continually point to these two facts as the major evidence that humans are causing the global warming Earth has recently experienced. The weak link in this argument is that empirical science has not established an unambiguous connection between the carbon dioxide increase and the observed global warming. The real scientific controversy about global warming is not about the presence of additional carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from human activities, which is well established, but about the extent to which that additional carbon dioxide affects climate, now or in the future.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02Earth's climate is constantly changing from natural causes that, for the most part, are not understood. How are we to distinguish the human contribution, which may be very small, from the natural contribution, which may be small or large? Put another way, is the additional carbon dioxide humans are adding to the atmosphere likely to have a measurable effect on global temperature, which is in any case changing continually from natural causes? Or is the temperature effect from the additional carbon dioxide likely to be imperceptible, and therefore unimportant as a practical matter?

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02Global warming is not something that happened only recently. In Earth's long history, climate change is the rule rather than the exception, and studies of Earth's temperature record going back a million years clearly reveal a number of climate cycles-warming and cooling trends. Their causes are multiple-possibly including periodic changes in solar output and variations in Earth's tilt and orbit-but poorly understood. In recent times, Earth entered a warming period. From thermometer records, we know that the air at Earth's surface warmed about 0.6[degrees]C over the period from the 1860s to the present. The observed warming, however, does not correlate well with the growth in fossil fuel use during that period. About half of the observed warming took place before 1940, though it was only after 1940 that the amounts of greenhouse gases produced by fossil fuel burning rose rapidly, as a result of the heavy industrial expansions of World War II and the postwar boom (80 percent of the carbon dioxide from human activities was added to the air after 1940).

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02Surprisingly, from about 1940 until about 1980, during a period of rapid increase in fossil fuel burning, global surface temperatures actually displayed a slight cooling trend rather than an acceleration of the warming trend that would have been expected from greenhouse gases. During the 1970s some scientists even became concerned about the possibility of a new ice age from an extended period of global cooling (a report of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences reflected that concern). Physicist Freeman Dyson notes that "the onset of the next ice age [would be] a far more severe catastrophe than anything associated with warming."

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02Earth's cooling trend did not continue beyond 1980, but neither has there been an unambiguous warming trend. Since 1980, precise temperature measurements have been made in Earth's atmosphere and on its surface, but the results do not agree. The surface air measurements indicate significant warming (0.25 to 0.4[degrees]C), but the atmospheric measurements show very little, if any, warming.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02Briefly, then, the record is this: From 1860 to 1940, Earth's surface warmed about 0.4[degrees]C. Then Earth's surface cooled about 0.1[degrees]C in the first four decades after 1940 and warmed about 0.3[degrees]C in the next two. For those two most recent decades, temperature measurements of the atmosphere have also been available, and, while these measurements are subject to significant uncertainty, they indicate that the atmosphere's temperature has remained essentially unchanged. Thus, the actual temperature record does not support the claims widely found in environmental literature and the media that Earth has been steadily warming over the past century. (A new study that may shed more light on this question - one of a number sure to come - has been circulated but is being revised and has not yet been published.)

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02For the probable disparity between the surface and atmospheric temperature trends of the past 20 years, several explanations have been offered. The first is that large urban centers create artificial heating zones - "heat islands" - that can contribute to an increase of surface temperature (though one analysis concludes that the heat island effect is too small to explain the discrepancy fully). The second explanation is that soot and dust from volcanic eruptions may have contributed to cooling of the atmosphere by blocking the Sun's heat (though this cooling should have affected both surface and atmospheric temperatures). In the United States, despite the presence of large urban areas, surface cooling after 1930 far exceeded that of Earth as a whole, and the surface temperature has subsequently warmed only to the level of the 1930s.IMAGE GRAPHWide fluctuations in surface temperatures have been the norm in Earth's history. These estimates are derived from oxygen-isotope ratios in fossilized plankton from the ocean floor.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02It's frequently claimed that the recent increases in surface temperature are uniquely hazardous to Earth's ecosystems because of the rapidity with which they are occurring-more than 0.1[degrees]C in a decade. That may be true, but some past climate changes were rapid as well. For example, around 14,700 years ago, temperatures in Greenland apparently jumped 5[degrees]C in less than 20 years-almost three times the warming from greenhouse gases predicted to occur in this entire century by the most pessimistic scientists.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02Whatever the current rate of surface warming, there is little justification for the view that Earth's climate should be unchanging, and that any climate change now occurring must have been caused by humans and should therefore be fixed by humans. In fact, as noted earlier, changing climate patterns and cycles have occurred throughout Earth's history. For millions of years, ice sheets regularly waxed and waned as global heating and cooling processes took place. During the most recent ice age, some 50,000 years ago, ice sheets covered much of North America, northern Europe, and northern Asia. About 12,000 years ago a warming trend began, signaling the start of an interglacial period that continues to this day. This warm period may have peaked 5,000 to 6,000 years ago, when global ice melting accelerated and global temperatures became higher than today's. Interglacial periods are thought to persist for about 10,000 years, so the next ice age may be coming soon-that is, in 500 to 1,000 years.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02Within the current interglacial period, smaller cyclic patterns have emerged. In the most recent millennium, several cycles occurred during which Earth alternately warmed and cooled. There's evidence for an unusually warm period over at least parts of the globe from the end of the first millennium to about 1300. A mild climate in the Northern Hemisphere during those centuries probably facilitated the migration of Scandinavian peoples to Greenland and Iceland, as well as their first landing on the North American continent, just after 1000. The settlements in Greenland and Iceland thrived for several hundred years but eventually were abandoned when the climate turned colder, after about 1450. The cold period, which lasted until the late 1800s, is often called the Little Ice Age. Agricultural productivity fell, and the mass exodus to North America of many Europeans is attributed at least in part to catastrophic crop failures such as the potato famine in Ireland.IMAGE GRAPHScientists know that mean global surface air temperatures have been rising for a century, but they don't know for certain why-nor why temperatures fell between 1940 and 1980.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02A plausible interpretation of most or all of the observed surface warming over the past century is that Earth is in the process of coming out of the Little Ice Age cold cycle that began 600 years ago. The current warming trend could last for centuries, until the expected arrival of the next ice age, or it could be punctuated by transient warm and cold periods, as were experienced in the recent millennium.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02A great deal of global warming rhetoric gives the impression that science has established beyond doubt that the recent warming is mostly due to human activities. But that has not been established. Though human use of fossil fuels might contribute to global warming in the future, there's no hard scientific evidence that it is already doing so, and the difficulty of establishing a human contribution by empirical observation is formidable. One would need to detect a very small amount of warming caused by human activity in the presence of a much larger background of naturally occurring climate change-a search for the proverbial needle in a haystack.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02Still, understanding climate change is by no means beyond science's reach, and research is proceeding in several complementary ways. Paleoclimatologists have been probing Earth's past climatic changes and are uncovering exciting new information about Earth's climate history going back thousands, and even millions, of years. This paleohistory will help eventually to produce a definitive picture of Earth's evolving climate, and help in turn to clarify the climate changes we're experiencing in our own era. But we are far from knowing enough to be able to predict what the future may hold for Earth's climate.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02Mindful of the limited empirical knowledge about climate, some climate scientists have been attempting to understand possible future changes by using computer modeling techniques. By running several scenarios, the modelers obtain a set of theoretical projections of how global temperature might change in the future in response to assumed inputs, governed mainly by the levels of fossil fuel use. But like all computer modeling, even state-of-the-art climate modeling has significant limitations. For example, the current models cannot simulate the natural variability of climate over centurylong time periods. A further major shortcoming is that they project only gradual climate change, whereas the most serious impacts of climate change could come about from abrupt changes. (A simple analogy is to the abrupt formation of frost, causing leaf damage and plant death, when the ambient air temperature gradually dips below the freezing point.) Given the shortcomings, policymakers should exercise considerable caution in using current climate models as quantitative indicators of future global warming.IMAGE ILLUSTRATIONScientists have long been aware that physical factors other than greenhouse gases can influence atmospheric temperature. Among the most important are aerosols-tiny particles (sulfates, black carbon, organic compounds, and so forth) introduced into the atmosphere by a variety of pollution sources, including automobiles and coal-burning electricity generators, as well as by natural sources such as sea spray and desert dust. Some aerosols, such as black carbon, normally contribute to heating of the atmosphere because they absorb the Sun's heat (though black carbon aerosols residing at high altitudes can actually cool Earth's surface because they block the Sun's rays from getting through to it). Other aerosols, composed of sulfates and organic compounds, cool the atmosphere because they reflect or scatter the Sun's rays away from Earth. Current evidence indicates that aerosols may be responsible for cooling effects at Earth's surface and warming effects in Earth's atmosphere. But the impacts of pollution on Earth's climate are very uncertain. The factors involved are difficult to simulate, but they must be included in computer models if the models are to be useful indicators of future climate. When climate models are finally able to incorporate the full complexity of pollution effects, especially from aerosols, the projected global temperature change could be either higher or lower than current projections, depending on the chemistry, altitude, and geographic region of the particular aerosols involved. Or, it could even be zero.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02In addition to pollution, other physical factors that can influence surface and atmospheric temperature are methane (another greenhouse gas), dust from volcanic activity, and changes in cloud cover, ocean circulation patterns, air-sea interactions, and the Sun's energy output. "The forcings that drive long-term climate change," concludes James Hansen, one of the pioneers of climate change science, "are not known with an accuracy sufficient to define future climate change. Anthropogenic greenhouse gases, which are well measured, cause a strong positive forcing [warming]. But other, poorly measured, anthropogenic forcings, especially changes of atmospheric aerosols, clouds, and land-use patterns, cause a negative forcing that tends to offset greenhouse warming." And as if the physical factors were not challenging enough, the inherent complexity of the climate system will always be present to thwart attempts to predict future climate.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02In view of climate's complexity and the limitations of today's climate simulations, one might expect that pronouncements as to human culpability for climate change would be made with considerable circumspection, especially pronouncements made in the name of the scientific community. So it was disturbing to many scientists that a summary report of the IPCC issued in 1996 contained the assertion that "the balance of evidence suggests a discernible climate change due to human activities." The latest IPCC report (2001) goes even further, claiming that "there is new and stronger evidence that most of the warming observed over the last 50 years is attributable to human activities." But most of this evidence comes from new computer simulations and does not satisfactorily address either the disparity in the empirical temperature record between surface and atmosphere or the large uncertainties in the contributions of aerosols and other factors. A report issued by the National Academy of Sciences in 2001 says this about the model simulations:

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02Because of the large and still uncertain level of natural variability inherent in the climate record and the uncertainties in the time histories of the various forcing agents (and presumably aerosols), a causal linkage between the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and the observed climate changes during the 20th century cannot be unequivocally established. The fact that the magnitude of the observed warming is large in comparison to natural variability as simulated in climate models is suggestive of such a linkage, but it does not constitute proof of one because the model simulations could be deficient in natural variability on the decadal to century time scale.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02These IPCC reports have been adopted as the centerpiece of most current popularizations of global warming in the media and in the environmental literature, and their political impact has been enormous. The 1996 report was the principal basis for government climate policy in most industrial countries, including the United States. The IPCC advised in the report that drastic reductions in the burning of fossil fuels would be required to avoid a disastrous global temperature increase. That advice was the driving force behind the adoption in 1997 of the Kyoto protocol to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in the near future.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02In its original form, the protocol had many flaws. First, it exempted developing countries, including China, India, and Brazil, from the emission cutbacks; such countries are increasingly dependent on fossil fuels, and their current greenhouse gas emissions already exceed those of the developed countries. Second, it mandated short-term reductions in fossil fuel use to reach the emission targets without regard to the costs of achieving those targets. Forced cutbacks in fossil fuel use could have severe economic consequences for industrial countries (the protocol would require the United States to cut back its fossil fuel combustion by over 30 percent to reach the targeted reduction of carbon dioxide emissions by 2010), and even greater consequences for poor countries should they ultimately agree to be included in the emissions targets. The costs of the cutbacks would have to be paid up front, whereas the assumed benefits would come only many decades later. Third, the fossil fuel cutbacks mandated by the protocol are too small to be effective-averting, by one estimate, only 0.06[degrees]C of global warming by 2050.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02The Kyoto protocol was signed in 1997 by many industrial countries, including the United States, but to have legal status, it must be ratified by nations that together account for 55 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. As of June 2002, the protocol had been ratified by 73 countries, including Japan and all 15 nations of the European Union. These countries are responsible, in all, for only 36 percent of emissions, but the 55 percent requirement may be met by Russia's expected ratification. Nonetheless, the treaty is unlikely to have real force without ratification by the United States. The Bush administration opposes the treaty, on the grounds of its likely negative economic impact on America, and has thus far not sought Senate ratification. Even the Clinton administration did not seek ratification, despite its having signed the initial protocol, because it was aware that the U.S. Senate had unanimously adopted a resolution rejecting in principle any climate change treaty that does not include meaningful participation by developing countries.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02With the United States retaining its lone dissent, 165 nations agreed in November 2001 to a modified version of Kyoto that would ease the task of reducing carbon dioxide emissions by allowing nations to trade their rights to emit carbon dioxide, and by giving nations credit for the expansion of forests and farmland, which soak up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. A study by economist William Nordhaus in Science magazine (Nov. 9, 2001) finds that a Kyoto treaty modified along these lines would incur substantial costs, bring little progress toward its objective, and, because of the huge fund transfers that would result from the practice of emissions trading, stir political disputes. Nordhaus concludes that participation in the treaty would have cost the United States some $2.3 trillion over the coining decades-more than twice the combined cost to all other participants. It does not require sympathy with overall U.S. climate change policy to understand the nation's reluctance to be so unequal a partner in the Kyoto enterprise.

But regardless of the causes, we do know that Earth's surface has warmed during the past century. Although we don't know the extent to which it will warm in the future, or whether it will warm at all, we can't help but ask a couple of critical questions: How much does global warming matter? What would be the consequences if the global average temperature did actually rise during the current century by, say, some 2[degrees]C?

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02Some environmentalists have predicted dire consequences from the warming, including extremes of weather, the loss of agricultural productivity, a destructive rise in sea level, and the spread of diseases. Activists press for international commitments much stronger than the Kyoto protocol to reduce the combustion of fossil fuels, and they justify the measures as precautionary. Others counter that the social and economic impacts of forced reductions in fossil fuel use would be more serious than the effects of a temperature rise, which could be small, or even beneficial.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02Although the debate over human impacts on climate probably won't be resolved for decades, a case can be made for adopting a less alarmist view of a warmer world. In any event, the warmer world is already here. In the past 2,500 years, global temperatures have varied by more than 3[degrees]C, and some of the changes have been much more abrupt than the gradual changes projected by the IPCC. During all of recorded history, humans have survived and prospered in climate zones far more different from one another than those that might result from the changes in global temperatures now being discussed.

Warm periods have historically benefited the development of civilization, and cold periods have been detrimental. For example, the Medieval Warm Period, from about 900 to 1300, facilitated the Viking settlement of Iceland and Greenland, whereas the subsequent Little Ice Age led to crop failures, famines, and disease. Even a small temperature increase brings a longer and more frost-free growing season-an advantage for many farmers, especially those in large, cold countries such as Russia and Canada. Agronomists know that the enrichment of atmospheric carbon dioxide stimulates plant growth and development in greenhouses; such enrichment at the global level might be expected to increase vegetative and biological productivity and water-use efficiency. Studies of the issue from an economic perspective have reached the same conclusion: that moderate global warming would most likely produce net economic benefits, especially for the agriculture and forestry sectors. Of course, such projections are subject to great uncertainty and cannot exclude the possibility that unexpected negative impacts would occur.

Although the spread of disease is a complex matter, the main carriers of these diseases-which were common in North America, western Europe, and Russia during the 19th century, when the world was colder than it is today-are most likely humans traveling the globe and insects traveling with people and goods. The strongest ally against future disease is surely not a cold climate but concerted improvement in regional insect control, water quality, and public health. As poverty recedes and people's living conditions improve in the developing world, the level of disease, and its spread, can be expected to decrease. Paul Reiter, a specialist in insect-borne diseases, puts it this way:

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02Insect-borne diseases are not diseases of climate but of poverty. Whatever the climate, developing countries will remain at risk until they acquire window screens, air conditioning, modern medicine, and other amenities most Americans take for granted. As a matter of social policy, the best precaution is to improve living standards in general and health infrastructures in particular.

But in fact, sea level-which once was low enough to expose a land bridge between Siberia and Alaskais rising now, and has been rising for thousands of years. Recent analyses suggest that sea level rose at a rate of about one to two centimeters per century (0.4 to 0.8 inch) over the past 3,000 years. Some studies have interpreted direct sea-level measurements made throughout the 20th century to show that the level is now rising at a much faster rate, about 10 to 25 centimeters per century (4 to 10 inches), but other studies conclude that the rate is much lower than that. To whatever extent sea-level rise may have accelerated, the change is thought to have taken place before the period of industrialization.IMAGE ILLUSTRATIONBefore considering whether the ongoing sea-level rise has anything to do with human use of fossil fuels, let's examine what science has to say about how global temperature change may relate to sea-level change. The matter is more complicated than it first appears. Water expands as it warms, which would contribute to rising sea level. But warming increases the evaporation of ocean water, which could increase the snowfall on the Arctic and Antarctic ice sheets, remove water from the ocean, and lower sea level. The relative importance of these two factors is not known.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02We do know from studies of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet that it has been melting continuously since the last great ice age, about 20,000 years ago, and that sea level has been rising ever since. Continued melting of the ice sheet until the next ice age may be inevitable, in which case sea level would rise by 15 to 18 feet when the sheet was completely melted. Other mechanisms have been suggested for natural sea-level rise, including tectonic changes in the shape of the ocean basins. The theoretical computer climate models attribute most of the sea-level rise to thermal expansion of the oceans, and thus they predict that further global temperature increase (presumably from human activities) will accelerate the sea-level rise. But because these models cannot deal adequately with the totality of the natural phenomena involved, their predictions about sea-level rise should be viewed skeptically.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02The natural causes of sea-level rise are part of Earth's evolution. They have nothing to do with human activities, and there's nothing that humans can do about them. Civilization has always adjusted to such changes, just as it has adjusted to earthquakes and other natural phenomena. This is not to say that adjusting to natural changes is not sometimes painful, but if there's nothing we can do about certain natural phenomena, we do adjust to them, however painfully. Sea-level rise is, most likely, one of those phenomena over which humans have no control.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02Some environmentalists claim that weather-related natural disasters have been increasing in frequency and severity, presumably as a result of human-caused global warming, but the record does not support their claims. On the contrary, several recent statistical studies have found that natural disasters-hurricanes, typhoons, tropical storms, floods, blizzards, wildfires, heat waves, and earthquakes-are not on the increase. The costs of losses from natural disasters are indeed rising, to the dismay of insurance companies and government emergency agencies, but that's because people in affluent societies construct expensive properties in places vulnerable to natural hazards, such as coastlines, steep hills, and forested areas.IMAGE ILLUSTRATIONBecause society has choices, we must ask what the likely effects would be, on the one hand, if people decided to adjust to climate change, regardless of its causes, and, on the other, if governments implemented drastic policies to attempt to lessen the presumed human contribution to the change. From an economic perspective at least, adjusting to the change would almost surely come out ahead. Several analyses have projected that the overall cost of the worst-case consequences of warming would be no more than about a two percent reduction in world output. Given that average per capita income will probably quadruple during the next century, the potential loss seems small indeed. A recent economic study emphasizing adaptation to climate change indicates that in the market economy of the United States the overall impacts of modest global warming are even likely to be beneficial rather than damaging, though the amount of net benefit would be small, about 0.2 percent of the economy. (We need always to keep in mind the statistical uncertainties inherent in such analyses; there are small probabilities that the benefits or costs could turn out to be much greater than or much less than the most probable outcomes.)

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02In contrast, the economic costs of governmental actions restricting the use of fossil fuels could be large indeed, as suggested by the Nordhaus study cited earlier on the costs of compliance with the Kyoto treaty. One U.S. government study proposed that a cost-effective way of bringing about fossil fuel reductions would be a combination of carbon taxes and international trading in emissions rights. Emissions rights trading was, in fact, included in the modified Kyoto agreement. But such a trading scheme would result in huge income transfers, as rich nations paid poor nations for emissions quotas that the latter would probably not have used anyway-and it's not reasonable to assume that rich nations would be willing to do this.

The costs would be considerably higher if large reductions were forced upon the global economy over a short time period, or if, as is likely, the most economically efficient schemes to bring about the reductions were not actually employed. Political economists Henry Jacoby, Ronald Prinn, and Richard Schmalensee put the matter bluntly: "It will be nearly impossible to slow climate warming appreciably without condemning much of the world to poverty, unless energy sources that emit little or no carbon dioxide become competitive with conventional fossil fuels."

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02Some global warming has been under way for more than a century, at least partly from natural causes, and the world has been adjusting to it as it did to earlier climate changes. If human activity is finally judged to be adding to the natural warming, the amount of the addition is probably small, and society can adjust to that as well, at relatively low cost or even net benefit. But the industrial nations are not likely to carry out inefficient, Kyoto-type mandated reductions in fossil fuel use on the basis of so incomplete a scientific foundation as currently exists. The costs of so doing could well exceed the potential benefits. Far more effective would be policies and actions by the industrial countries to accelerate the development, in the near term, of technologies that utilize fossil fuels (and all resources) more efficiently and, in the longer term, of technologies that do not require the use of fossil fuels.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-02If climate science is to have any credibility in the future, its pursuit must be kept separate from global politics. The affluent nations should support research programs that improve the theoretical understanding of climate change, build an empirical database about factors that influence long-term climate change, and increase our understanding of short-term weather dynamics. Such research is fundamental to the greenhouse gas issue. But its rewards may be greater still, for it will also improve our ability to cope with extreme weather events such as hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods, whatever their causes.SIDEBARTHE ACTUAL TEMPERATURE RECORD DOES NOT SUPPORT THE CLAIMS THAT EARTH HAS BEEN STEADILY WARMING OVER THE PAST CENTURY.SIDEBARPOLICYMAKERS SHOULD EXERCISE CONSIDERABLE CAUTION IN USING CURRENT CLIMATE MODELS AS QUANTITATIVE INDICATORS OF FUTURE GLOBAL WARMING.SIDEBARWHAT WOULD BE THE CONSEQUENCES IF THE GLOBAL AVERAGE TEMPERATURE ROSE DURING THE CURRENT CENTURY BY SOME TWO DEGREES CENTIGRADE?SIDEBAREVEN A SMALL TEMPERATURE INCREASE BRINGS A LONGER AND MORE FROST-FREE GROWING SEASON-AN ADVANTAGE FOR MANY FARMERS.AUTHOR_AFFILIATION&lt;JACK M.

It usually affects monkeys, but in 1995 there was an outbreak in the human population of Kikwit, Democratic Republic of Congo, only 200 km/125 mi from the capital Kinshasa. The World Health Organization declared the outbreak officially over in August 1995; 244 of the 315 people who had contracted the virus had died. Further outbreaks were reported in several African countries, including Gabon (February 1996) and Uganda (September 2000 and November 2007).

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/105/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-03 A. Benton Chafin Jr., a freshman state delegate, easily defeated Democrat Mike Hymes Tuesday to capture the 38th District Senate seat that Phillip P. Puckett (D-Russell) abruptly resigned in June. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/105/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-03 On a conference call with reporters, House Speaker William J. Howell (R-Stafford) and Senate Majority Leader Thomas K. Norment Jr. (R-James City) said voters gave GOP lawmakers a mandate that strengthens their bargaining position against Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D). After Tuesday's win, Republicans will keep control of the Senate even if Democrats hang on to the seat vacated by the retirement of Henry L. Marsh III (Richmond) in July. That seat will be filled in November. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/105/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-03 "I think that Governor McAuliffe is continuing to mature as a governor and that he is continuing to learn about the nuances of governing," Norment said. The new Senate majority "will perhaps give him some encouragement and act as a catalyst for him to sit down with Republican members of the House of Delegates and Republican members of the Senate to see if we can work together to work collaboratively to move Virginia forward." 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/105/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-03 Howell and Norment stressed that the two chambers are united, in contrast with the state Republican Party, which is riven by a struggle between moderate establishment members and an insurgent wing of tea party supporters and other conservative activists. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/105/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-03 Asked what they hoped to accomplish with their new 21-to-18 advantage in the Senate, as well as their comfortable House majority, Howell and Norment did not lay out a legislative agenda. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/105/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-03 Howell did say that he and House Majority Leader M. Kirkland Cox (R-Colonial Heights) met with McAuliffe on Tuesday to discuss working together on two proposals. They want to secure state funding for veteran-care centers in Hampton Roads and Northern Virginia and to set up apprenticeship academies to train workers in advanced manufacturing. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/105/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-03 "Governor McAuliffe is focused on creating jobs and growing our economy, and he is ready to work with anyone to accomplish those goals," McAuliffe spokesman Brian Coy said in a statement. "The Governor has built productive partnerships with Republicans and Democrats on a number of key issues, and he looks forward to continuing to work with both parties to build the new economy Virginia families deserve." 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/105/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-03 Like the governor, the Republican leaders provided no specifics on where they would cut $882 million from planned spending to offset the three-year, $2.4 billion projected shortfall that McAuliffe announced last week. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/105/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-03 Turning to politics, Howell echoed a campaign message of Ed Gillespie, the Republican trying to unseat U.S. Sen. Mark R. Warner this year. Warner campaigned for Hymes to no avail. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/105/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-03 "The people in southwest Virginia see President Obama and the Democrat Party have abandoned them, and now they returned the favor. And I don't think this is very good news for Senator Warner," Howell said. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/105/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-03 He added: "I think this election certainly bodes well for Ed Gillespie and his election down in southwest Virginia." 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/105/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-03 Warner courted voters in that rural region during his successful 2001 campaign for governor and recently returned from a swing through the area. "Senator Warner has spent years helping boost southwest Virginia's economy while Ed Gillespie spent much of his career as a self-described partisan warrior and a lobbyist for Enron. The difference between the two could not be clearer," Warner campaign spokesman David Turner said.

This statement serves to clarify the two primary definitions of humanism. First of all, humanism was a movement that arose during the 14th century in Italy. The time in which humanism flourished was called the Renaissance, which means ÂrebirthÂ (see Renaissance).

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-03Humanism was, in fact, the essence of the Renaissance. It involved a revival of study of the ancient Latin and Greek authors in order to learn about them for their own sake, to see them in their proper historical context. It involved trying to see what the ancient authors had actually meant, uninfluenced by specifically Christian interpretations of them.

Like the 17th-century Enlightenment, humanism expressed a confidenceÂperhaps even an overconfidenceÂin humanity's ability to exert control over nature or to shape society according to its needs and desires. (See also Enlightenment.)

Some religious leaders denounce any attitude that rejects religion while promoting purely human goals and values. In a sense, however, all humanism is secular in that it separates the worldly or temporal from the spiritual or eternal.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-03Humanism derives from the Latin word humanitas. The word obviously means Âhumanity,Â but in relation to humanism it signifies more. For the Roman statesman Cicero, humanitas meant cultivation of the mind, a certain kind of broad education needed to function adequately in society. Such an education was designed to allow people to explore the whole range of knowledge, including the sciences and mathematics, in order to develop their full potential. Today the word humanities signifies this type of education.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-03For the Italian Renaissance humanists, the humanities consisted primarily of studying the ancient, pre-Christian authors. It also meant using the knowledge they gained to promote the development of human capacities, to open new possibilities for mankind. One of the new directions was exploration of the natural world by science. Ancient scientific texts spurred the scholars of the Renaissance to rethink the world and the universe, to reject notions that had become official doctrines in the church, and to look in new directions with new methods. Hence there occurred the birth of modern science and mathematics in the work of such men as Galileo, Copernicus, and Leonardo.

As they gained economic strength, they wanted to govern themselves and to be free from control by the religious and governmental authorities that had developed during the Middle Ages. Traditional institutions were seen as obstacles to economic progress and to the emergence and testing of new ideas.

Their goal was to remove religion as a prime dominating and obstructive force in their lives and to establish it as one of several institutions in society. Religion was seen to have a valid civil function: it no longer pointed only toward heaven as mankind's ultimate goal; it opened the possibility of happiness and prosperity on Earth by exalting work, creativity, and political participation.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-03This attitude toward religion helped breed tolerance among humanists. Because they believed in the unity of all truth, they regarded diverse religious points of view as expressions of that one truth. This spirit of tolerance was not highly regarded by the churches, however. It took several centuries of conflict and effort, culminating in the Enlightenment, before the idea of general religious tolerance became widely accepted. (See also church and state.)

By the 15th century it had spread north of the Alps. Originally those who wanted a humanist education had to travel to the universities of Italy, but by the end of the 15th century such cities as Antwerp, London, Paris, and Augsburg were becoming humanist centers.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects a 22.8 percent increase in employment for software developers through 2022, more than double the 10.8 percent increase in overall employment. The median wage isn't too shabby, either: $101,410, according to the Labor Department. As more commerce -- from making restaurant reservations to routing steel shipments -- moves online and people increasingly search online via smartphones, tablets and other mobile devices instead of PCs, businesses will need more people to create and customize software, the Labor Department says.

In 2007, North Carolina State University launched the Institute for Advanced Analytics, whose mission is to teach students how to derive insights from reams of data. In 2013, the University of Texas launched UT3D, billed as the nation's first comprehensive 3-D production program that trains students to produce 3-D plays and documentaries and to explore innovations such as "glasses-free" 3-D for TVs, tablets and cellphones. And this fall, the University of Maryland will add an upper-level data science class to teach students how to mine vast quantities of user-generated data for analytical insights. U-Md. has offered a class in mobile app development since 2010.

"Students come in and say, 'I can do all this stuff on my computer,' and I think, 'How good are you at math?' " says Pearl Y. Wang, associate chair of George Mason University's computer science department.

"I want to make sure [a] kid is getting an education that will help them have a solid, long-term career in the field," she says.

She urges high schoolers who want to work for Tumblr to take on side projects that incorporate Tumblr to catch the company's attention for an internship or a post-college job. She says young hires need to prove they've been part of a team that developed a product and can articulate what worked and what didn't.

"We look for people who can contribute in areas, not just in their roles," she says. "We love people who are well-rounded, ambitious and team-oriented."

So did a group of vice presidents at New York-Presbyterian Hospital, several physicians at Children's Hospital in New Orleans, and Broward Health CEO Frank Nask in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. We hear the camera wasn't working so well in Lincoln, Neb., and Dr. Cliff Robertson, CEO of Catholic Health Initiative's Nebraska/Southwest Iowa Network, had to take the challenge twice.

Have yourself videotaped being doused with ice water and then challenge one or more other people to do the same in 24 hours or donate $100 to the ALS Association. Those who take the challenge can donate less than the designated amount.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-03An overwhelming majority of parents want only the best for their children. But good intentions can go awry -- as shown in the latest data on childhood vaccinations.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-03The number of Volusia and Flagler children who aren't being vaccinated against preventable diseases such as whooping cough, tetanus, measles and other serious illnesses is on the increase. The trend is particularly alarming in Flagler County, where 8.6 percent of kindergartners weren't vaccinated in 2013-14. The numbers weren't much better in Volusia County, where 7.5 percent of kindergarten- aged children weren't vaccinated. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-03Though some children can't be vaccinated for legitimate medical reasons, a growing number of parents are opting out due to baseless fear-mongering over the safety and efficacy of vaccines. In Florida, that can be seen by the sharp increase in the number of so-called "religious" objections to vaccines -- despite the fact that few major religions cite any objection to vaccination. Flagler County saw a sharp increase in the rate of religious exemptions last year - - which puzzles county Public Health Director Patrick Johnson -- though the number of exemptions remains relatively small. Florida law does require parents to contact their county health department to claim a religious exemption, and are told that health officials may pull their children out of school if one of their fellow students is diagnosed with a vaccine-preventable illness. That step may deter some parents. But the trend suggests that Florida lawmakers should re-examine school vaccination laws to see if they should be tightened.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-03There's good reason to do so. Preventing the infectious diseases targeted by Florida's required vaccines depends on having most, if not all, of the population vaccinated. Thus, a decline in vaccinations poses a danger to all Florida children, not just the ones denied protection by misguided or misinformed parents. Many of the diseases included in Florida's required childhood vaccination list are easily transmissible, such as mumps and measles. Non- vaccinated children can become vectors for illnesses, spreading disease to infants too young to be vaccinated or children with compromised immune systems.

It was one of the worst outbreaks in decades, and took the lives of 10 infants. Notably, California's laws make it very easy for parents to opt out of vaccinating their children, something public health officials cited as significant. Across Florida, public health officials have reported localized outbreaks of measles and whooping cough as well.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-03The deepest irony in the vaccine debate is that many non- immunizing parents argue that they are trying to protect their little ones from autism or other conditions said to be linked to vaccines. But though some children do exhibit minor physical reactions to vaccines, such as soreness at the injection site, mild fevers or irritability, there's no credible medical evidence supporting serious or lasting health effects. Meanwhile, the dangers posed by the communicable diseases immunizations protect against are very real.

Fields initially said Thomas Clay Friday, 41, had asked him and a brother to help kill someone for "some quick money." Fields initially denied knowing anything more, other than Friday's bragging about killing someone.

Fields went back on his story, became animated, and said he was intoxicated the night Friday told him to get in his truck and drove him to a woman's house.

Last year, jurors found Robert Dennis Dixon, 50, guilty first-degree murder, finding he hired Friday to arrange for the murder of his stepmother to gain control of family property. Dennis Dixon is serving a life sentence. Friday pleaded guilty and testified against Dixon, receiving a life- sentence.

Later, the truck broke down on the property. They walked through some property to a "white man's house." That man -- later identified as Dennis Dixon -- drove Friday and Fields to get another of Friday's vehicles.

The town is paying for the software, wireless capability, and teacher iPads.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-05Global warming is the gradual increase in Earth's temperature. The sun's rays heat the Earth. Some energy is absorbed by Earth's surface and converted into heat. More than one-third of this energy radiates back in to space. But some is prevented from escaping by greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The most common greenhouse gases are carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, water vapor, and fluorinated gases. Most greenhouse gases occur naturally, and help to make life on Earth possible. Without the natural greenhouse effect, the Earth would be about 60 colder than it is today.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-05Since the mid-1800s, humans have been releasing more and more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Most of it comes from burning fossil fuels-like coal, natural gas, and oil-which produce carbon dioxide. Factories, farms, and landfills also add extra greenhouse gases. Deforestation adds to the problem, because trees absorb carbon dioxide.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-05There is more carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere today than has been normal for the last 650,000 years, trapping more of the sun's energy. The decade from 998-2007 was the warmest ever recorded. Scientists now find it very likely that humans are the primary cause of this global warming. They estimate that carbon dioxide has caused up to 70% of the enhanced greenhouse effect.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-05(on camera):  On July 8th, 1947, Colonel William H. Blanchard, commanding officer of the 509th Bomb Group at Roswell Army Air Field released a press statement that a flying saucer had crashed near Roswell and that the Army had recovered the disk within hours.  A second press release was issued, claiming that it was nothing more than a weather balloon.

He is co-author of, "Witness to Roswell: Unmasking the 60-year Cover-up."  It's one of Don's bestselling books, became the TV movie "Roswell." At Building 84 in Roswell, Thomas J. Carey, co-author of, "Witness to Roswell: Unmasking the 60-year Cover-up," he spent 16 years investigating all of this.  Also at Building 84 is Earl Fulford, a staff sergeant stationed at what was the army field in 1947.  He took part in what he calls the top secret retrieval of Roswell debris.

My father was a highly respected man in his field.  He -- it warms my heart to think about him, because he was in top secret and he actually was unable to tell my sister, my mother and myself about what he was doing.

And he said, he had to think for a minute and he said, "the best way to put it," without revealing anything, he said, "Actually, there are documented facts about UFOs, but we will never in our lifetime," as you've said, ever - "They will never be revealed, because of panic risk, mass panic."

Let's look back to the very people who were involved.  There was no panic.  There was no mass suicide.  These people all lived out their lives and worked their jobs and raised their families.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-05I'd hate to think that we've digressed over the past 61 years, to the point that this would be such a shock, not only to our very psyche and our very culture, that there would be such an overreaction.  I think we're ready.  I certainly know that they handled it the best they could back in '47.  And it would be a tremendous tragedy after all this time that we wouldn't bring the information out.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-05KING:  Why, Thomas Carey, why now?  We've been hearing about Roswell for years, and everyone says the government covers it up.  It's going to be released, the files will be released.  Why now?

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-05CAREY:  Well, Larry, we hold no brief from the government.  Don Schmitt and I are conducting our investigation on the belief that the government will never release this information.  In 1947, there was ample reason for them to cover up the incident.  The Cold War was just beginning.  The Orson Welles' "War of the Worlds" radio broadcast which set the East coast in the panic, was still in memory.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-05ROONEY:  No, he actually, as I said, he was in top secret, so he wouldn't be able to reveal anything to any of our family.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-05KING:  Even at his death?

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-05KING:  Didn't you question more fully when he admitted to having, to believing this?  I would have gone nuts.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-05ROONEY:  Of course.  Yes, but I was a bit younger then.  And I hadn't really thought about all this.  I didn't know that this was all science fiction or what.  It wasn't until I got older and dad was already gone when I really took hold of this idea and really wanted to investigate.  And it's too late now.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-05KING:  So, you believe in aliens, travel from outer space?

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-05And what did he tell you, Carlene?

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-05CARLENE GREEN, SAYS FATHER SAW ALIEN BODIES:  Well, what he told me, Larry, he said, "Don't let anybody tell you that the incident at Roswell did not happen."  He said it did happen.  "I was there.  I saw the spacecraft.  And I saw the graves." KING:  Why did he think that they kept it a secret?

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-05GREEN:  That he never told me.  He never discussed it.  He never uttered a word about it.  Until just before -- they put him on the gurney to put him in the ambulance, and sent him to El Paso.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-05KING:  Why did he not talk about it?

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-05GREEN:  That, I don't know, other than the fact that -- with the incident, when it happened, that they were told, don't talk about it, it didn't happen.  It was a weather balloon.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-05KING:  So, he completely dismissed that to you?

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-05GREEN:  Yes, he did.  He never mentioned anything else to me.  He never said anything else to me.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-05KING:  Did you ever doubt your father, what type of soldier was he?

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-05GREEN:  I never doubted him for a moment.  He was an honest man.  He loved his country, and he loved his family.  When the military told him to do something, he did it.  He never questioned it.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-05KING:  Jan Rooney, did you ever doubt your father?

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-05ROONEY:  Never.  My father was a very honest, hard-working man, very responsible, dependable individual, and a no nonsense kind of guy.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-05And what he says goes.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-05KING:  And back to the original Don Schmitt, what are they hiding?

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-05SCHMITT:  Well, I think they're hiding, first of all, the fact that they did not provide many of the -- especially, civilian witnesses with due process.  The fact that they threatened these people, that they went into their homes, and actually threatened physical violence if they should ever talk about this, it's hardly...

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-05KING:  But that was years ago.  They're not going to do that now, would they?

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-05SCHMITT:  No.  In fact, it's one of the reasons that we encouraged the witnesses to come forward.  Because, after all, the official explanation after now 61 years, is still that, that this is nothing more than a weather balloon.  So, in other words, that's forced their hand.  Let's see how they retaliate.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-05We still have reluctant witnesses who are still very afraid to talk, fear of loss of pension, and benefits, fear of imprisonment if they speak about this.  This was a sacred oath, an oath to the Constitution that they made back in 1947 -- part of that World War II generation, and you know, they keep their word, they certainly do.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-05KING:  Thomas Carey, do you have any doubts the other way?  Do you ever think that maybe you're wrong?

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-05CAREY:  At this point, Larry, no.  We've interviewed so many witnesses.  We have hundreds of witnesses that have told us of an extraterrestrial event.  I can tell you and your audience tonight that none of them have told us about a weather balloon.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-05KING:  Do you think, Jan, we will ever really learn the truth?  I mean, do you think the government will ever come forward and say, "All the people on your show, they're right"?

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-05ROONEY:  I think at some point they will have to, because of the overwhelming evidence.  They can't keep it a secret forever.  How long can they go?

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-05KING:  Will it take, do you think, Carlene, somebody in the Pentagon?

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-05Who's going to announce this?

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-05KING:  Do you firmly believe -- in this lifetime?

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-05GREEN:  In my lifetime, yes.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-05KING:  Because, Jan, we've been hearing this for years.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-05ROONEY:  That's right.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-05ROONEY:  It never comes out, I know.  But somebody has to do something.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-05KING:  Don Schmitt, do you think it's going to come out in your lifetime?

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-05SCHMITT:  We've been hearing for years about this growing faction within the military that certainly would like it to come out.  And as evidenced by the fact that the government is now up to their fourth official explanation regarding this incident, I've become more and more doubtful.  I think it becomes all the more incumbent on us, as investigators, to still track down every surviving, every living witness, and get them to go on the record.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-05KING:  We're going to get to break.  We'll come right back to you.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-05Thank you, Jan.  Thanks very much.

Her father was a fireman in Roswell and he went out on a fire call in 1947, returned home and reported to his family that in addition to a crashed saucer, he saw two full body bags and one living little person about the size of a small 10-year-old.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-05Essentially, Frankie, your father was telling you he saw an alien, right?

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-05KING:  What did he say?  What did he make of it?

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-05ROWE:  He said that they tried to help it, and that the little person told them that there was nothing that they could do to help him.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-05KING:  Did he go a little berserk over this?  Did he try to tell other officials?  Did he try to go to the press?

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-05ROWE:  No.  He didn't do anything other than he was out there to do his job.  And that was all.  And before they could actually do anything there at the crash site itself, the military came and escorted them off of the location.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-05NYE:  Well, here's what it is, Larry.  Here's what it is.  It was a program called the Skyhook weather balloon," and it was absolutely a secret.  It was a U.S. military secret.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-05The Skyhook balloon was to be part of a system, or a constellation of balloons off the east coast of the former Soviet Union, fitted with microphones -- this sounds extraordinary, and it was -- fitted with microphones that would listen for distinctive sounds associated with Soviet nuclear tests.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-05KING:  Spying.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-05NYE:  Spying -- conventional regular spying.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-05KING:  So, these people who saw things, the thing that landed.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-05NYE:  They saw a thing, yes, a huge thing.  It was the Skyhook weather balloon being tested at the Alamogordo Air Force or U.S. Army Air Force base before the Air Force, the Department of the Air Force was created, just a few months before that.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-05KING:  What about Frankie and her father?

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-05NYE:  Well, so, I think that when you have somebody recalling events from 61 years ago, it's like the game telephone you play with people, where you tell a story and you whisper it around the room.  These things get embellished.  There's a certain comedy show that has a whole bit about writers' embellishment.

So, I want everybody to evaluate this business about the Skyhook weather balloon.  They called it a weather balloon, but it was not.  It was a top-secret balloon to spy in a conventional way just before the U-2 airplane, before the SR- 71, before Corona, before spy satellite, any of that stuff; this was the state of the art.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-05KING:  Don Schmitt, how do you respond to that?

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-05SCHMITT:  Well, first much all, there's a problem with the timeline.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-05For anybody who has flown over the debris field location, that material was out there for days before it was even reported.

They weren't looking for anything because we weren't missing anything.  And if we weren't missing anything, I guess the conclusion would be, then, it wasn't ours.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-05NYE:  I think the exception to this idea that your claim that nobody was looking for it, are you sure nobody was looking for it or is it because it was a secret?

Why doesn't the government then, this being a fact, this being many years later, we're friends with Russia, there's no Soviet Union, we're not spying, release it, show us, tell us the story?  Why not?

There's a very good picture of the Skyhook balloon on the ship.  You get this sense of a size of it.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-05CAREY:  I think Mr. Nye is talking about Project Mogul, the Air Force project to detect the first Soviet nuclear blast expected in those days.  The problem with his analysis is that the balloons themselves are still made out of rubber, and tin foil, the targets were tin foil.

Weather balloons don't talk.  This little person communicated they'd been watching us for a long time.  And he said they're not here to hurt us, not to be afraid.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-05NYE:  Oh, yes.  But let's examine the evidence.  Let's start with the picture of the guy on the gurney, in the body bag.  The person or the thing in the body bag is not a little person.  That's the full length of a conventional gurney.  Might even be eight feet long.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-05So it might not be a little person in a body bag at all.  This, to me, is not evidence that we have been visited by aliens.  Let's also look at the box that was lifted off the flying saucer, you had earlier in the show.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-05Sorry, it's so extraordinary.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-05So in 1947 there is no doubt that if I'm coming in from another galaxy or something like that, New Mexico would be a pretty place to go.

We knew many of the people, including the ranch where this was discovered and in spite of all of the security oaths, etc, the talk in the community was, of what it was, that it was an alien craft and that survived all of the other stories and all of the other oaths and so forth.  It was there for a long time.  I happened to have lived there.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-05As a matter of fact, Robert Goddard, the father of American rocketry, his farm was right down the road from ours and I walked past his home every day going there.  So I feel fairly well-informed on all of this and like some of your earlier witnesses, Larry, whose fathers talked to them, whose parents talked to them, they were involved, we heard the same thing.  We knew it, it was not really covered up and so these stories did get out even though the day after the official announcement had come out in the "Roswell Record" newspaper and was repeated the next day, there was a lot of snickering and laughing going on about what in the world is going on here.

And we're now joined in Roswell, New Mexico by Lieutenant Colonel Wayne Mattson, United States Air Force, Retired.  A military historian, he spent 32 years in the military, a majority of which he spent in research and testing for the Air Force.

Because the Air Force is charged with keeping the skies clear of unwanted craft and if you can't stop one of these UFOs, you're not doing your job.  So therefore they don't exist.

It was also tracked by radar and then we got a visual on it and watched this large round object translate from a disk shape -- well, excuse me, from a -- the size of a full Moon to a disc shape and accelerate out of sight in a matter of seconds.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-05NYE:  Oh, no, no, no.  These people believe, absolutely.  But let's take another example that would change my mind.  There are hundreds of millions of cell phones in the United States that have cameras.  There are millions and millions more in the world that have cameras.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-05Every week there are millions and millions, every month there are billions of pictures taken.  Can I get one, one picture of one alien spacecraft?  Now are these guys saying that they found a piece of this spacecraft material and it's hidden?  Are they saying that they have found a piece of this spacecraft material and they lost it?

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-05It's quite extraordinary.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-05MATTSON:  There are a lot of picture taken, and there are probably a lot of pictures in hidden archives.  Project Blue Book was, in my opinion, merely a P.R. cover-up.  Most of the good stuff went somewhere else, to one of the air intelligence squadrons, and was buried deeply under cover.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-05CAREY:  Larry, I don't know that any thing could clear it up for your guest, Mr. Nye, but for the reasonable mind that is open, testimony -- overwhelming testimony will clear it up.  But I think for Mr. Nye, an unequivocal piece of the ship that crashed in 1947 might do the trick.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-05I'm not sure that it would.  He might say that it was a Hollywood trick or something like that.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-05But I think a piece of physical evidence, if I could go that far, should clear it up for Mr. Nye.  And I can report to your audience that we are working on obtaining physical evidence as we speak.

My name is Pat and We're about 75 miles or so from Roswell, New Mexico.  We'll be looking at the three field (ph) area where rancher Max Brasell (ph) found pieces of this craft scattered over a pretty wide area.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-05Here we are.  This is called the debris field.  An alien ship coming from the northwest comes right over this rise to this very location.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-05Max Brasell, a couple of miles from here, maybe three or four miles from here along this path, trajectory, said that he found some - a couple of alien bodies.  A couple of aliens, dead I guess, at that location.  They had been there for two days.  And the ship continued on and wherever that ship was found, the craft was, then there were more bodies found.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-05That's the way I understand it.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-05MATTSON:  Yes, I have looked at many of the Skyhook balloon records and right about the time the Air Force came out and said, we lied, it's not a weather balloon, it was really Project Mogul, they came out with a large document, several inches thick, called "The Roswell Incident." In it they claimed that the Mogul launch on the Fourth of June was the one responsible for the Roswell incident but in the same document they published the log of one of the technicians who was associated with the program and his entry for the 4th of June, 1947 indicated no balloon launch due to bad weather.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-05Now there was a balloon launched on the 5th of the June and the records show that was recovered 25 miles east of Roswell.  So the 4th of June the Air Force was wrong.  The 5th of June they had recovered the balloon itself.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-05NYE:  Is it possible for them to change that guy's record?  Isn't it a possible thing to recover something else?

And this was one that they really did cover up.  It was a thing they tried to do; they tried to build a spy balloon before spacecraft. And it didn't work so well, and it crashed, and it was a secret. And that is a pretty satisfactory explanation for me.  I feel pretty good about that.  I would love to find evidence ...

"The world needs to produce more food, more feed and more fuel because of the climate change concerns," he said. "So, agriculture has to produce more. But, the resources needed to do that is limited, particularly water. And, investment needed for agriculture modernization is not flowing in as we hoped for."

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-07Enrolling your child in gymnastics classes proves to have a variety of benefits. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-07 Birchmount Gymnastics is a great place to start. We offer a wide selection of programs for children of all ages. If you're wondering what kind of benefits your child will experience, here are just a few: 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-07 Strength Building. Gymnastics is an extremely physical sport that actually offers a full-body workout. Your child will build upper body strength on the balance beam, and lower body strength with floor exercises. Gymnastics also builds flexibility, endurance and coordination. Between all the lifts, swings and movements, your child will build their muscles and overall body strength in a fun way. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-07 Listening Skills. Children are encouraged to listen to their instructors in order to learn about new moves or equipment, and to be safe about their activities. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-07 Cognitive and Social Growth. Gymnastics classes will engage your child in an atmosphere at which they will have to listen to directions, take turns and work in a team. They'll meet new friends, and learn how to perform in front of other people with a great sense of belonging. In terms of cognitive development, your child will often envision a new move or skill before they try it. Gymnastics is not just about using your body, but also your brain. Your child will also learn a lot about focus and concentration. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-07 Goals. Gymnastics is great for children learning to set goals. They may want to perfect a move by the end of the season, or learn that back flip by the next class. Gymnastics teaches children about setting goals, and working hard to achieve them. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-07 These are only a few of the benefits that your child will obtain in participating in gymnastics.

"If you're a football player, you're a football player. That's been good for us, because we've never put a restriction on what level a guy played at. If he can fit in our system, and he has the personality, work ethic and character, he can play. He may need a few years, but once he is able to develop, those guys pan out."

One of South America's most popular ski resorts had operated there since 1939. At 5,260 meters (17,250 feet), it was the highest-elevation ski run in the world.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-08Glaciers are giant masses of ice that form on land when winter snow survives through the summer months. More snow falls on top the following year, and the weight of the new snow compresses the older layers into ice, which can slowly accumulate year after year. Mountain glaciers often flow down through valleys, like slow-motion rivers of ice. Other glaciers, known as ice sheets, cover huge expanses of land and gradually flow outward in all directions. Ice sheets cover most of Greenland and Antarctica. Pieces of glaciers that break off into the ocean are called icebergs.

"They're nature's thermometers," says Jason Box, a glaciologist at the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland.

About 95 percent of the 300,000 or so glaciers around the world are shrinking. Many, like Chacaltaya, will vanish; others will remain, but just barely.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-08The loss of glaciers is having profound effects on people, and not just skiers: Glacial ice accounts for about 70 percent of the planet's fresh water. When glaciers melt, the water they once held ends up in the ocean, causing sea levels to rise. That leaves coastal communities more susceptible to flooding. Also, the meltwater that flows down from glaciers in summer provides drinking water, irrigates crops, and powers hydroelectric plants. With glaciers in decline, many parts of the world are facing water shortages.

Only 25 remain today. Models developed by the United States Geological Survey in 2003 predicted that the park's glaciers would be gone by 2030, but scientists now believe most of the ice may melt even sooner- perhaps by 2020.

"Every day, it seems, we learn that the ice is more sensitive than we thought it was yesterday," says Box. "It reacts to changes faster than we thought it would."

Darker surfaces like sand, vegetation, or liquid water absorb heat easily. But white snow and ice have a high albedo. They reflect sunlight and help to keep the planet cool.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-08But as a glacier melts, the albedo of the area changes. When ice becomes thinner and patches of snow and ice become smaller, they reflect less sunlight. That means Earth's surface absorbs more solar energy and becomes warmer, which makes the snow and ice melt even faster. In other words, melting has a tendency to lead to more melting.

These particles cause ice to absorb more light and melt faster, but no one knows how much faster.

Scientists hope the results will help them make more accurate predictions about how quickly glaciers may melt and how much the planet may warm.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-08In some parts of the world, ski-resort owners are trying a creative strategy to reduce the amount of snow and ice lost during the summer melt-and to avoid the fate of Chacaltaya. In late spring, they cover parts of their glaciers in reflective blankets to increase albedo and minimize the amount of heat the ice absorbs. Glaciers in Switzerland, Italy, France, Germany, and Austria have received the blanket treatment. Researchers have found that it can reduce melting by 50 to 80 percent.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-08Box has tested the blanket approach in Greenland. "It can be valuable in targeted places where you really want to keep the ice," he says, such as on glaciers that provide critical water resources or at ski areas whose economies depend on glaciers. But at a cost of millions of dollars per square mile, "it just isn't feasible at large scales," says Box. "It becomes ridiculously expensive."

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-08Instead, Box says, the best bet for protecting the world's glaciers-and the fresh water they supply-is to slow the warming of the planet. That means reducing emissions of greenhouse gases, which trap heat in the atmosphere, and soot, which absorbs heat and reduces albedo when it lands on snow. Chacaltaya is gone for good, but there's still time to save many other glaciers by adopting clean energy sources like wind and solar power.

He stares unblinkingly out the storefront window of Taboo Tattoo, a studio in Dallas' Bishop Arts District. To his right, Cody Biggs shades blue into a square of the Texas state flag. His movements are sure, even.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/102/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-09The buzzing suddenly falls silent. Biggs pauses to dunk the hand piece into a thimble-size plastic cup of ink, then turns back to his canvas. Metzger's shoulder is pink and puffy, weeping streams of ink and blood.

As of 2012, 1 in 5 adults had a tattoo, up from 14 percent in 2008, a Harris Interactive Poll found. And when safety standards are followed, tattoos are usually trouble-free.

"A tattoo is like a minor surgery. You clean and shave the skin like you're going to operate. You use surgical tools. There are dangers. So be careful in your selection."

"Because you are bleeding, anything in contact with the tattoo -- bacteria, viruses -- can get into the wound and your entire body. It's like having a bite on your leg or a gigantic abrasion."

These infections were caused by a type of fast-growing bacteria that caused red, itchy bumps to severe sores requiring surgery. The 22 cases were associated with inks contaminated before distribution or just before tattooing.

Problems can range from allergic reactions to scarring to the formation of bumpy knots called granulomas, which are more common in people with darker skin. The long-term effects of ink are still unknown.

"I had a young gentleman come in, and he had a lymph node under his arm that was swollen. When we biopsied it, we found ink from his tattoo. We don't really know what happens internally."

The ink can camouflage changes in asymmetry, borders, color and diameter, the "ABCDs" of melanoma detection.

Volkow Director, National Institute on Drug Abuse,National Institutes of Health Committee on House Government Reform      Subcommittee on Criminal Justice, Drug Policy, and Human     ResourcesJune 28, 2006 Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee: Thank you forinviting the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), a component of theNational Institutes of Health (NIH), an agency of the U.S. Department ofHealth and Human Services (HHS), to participate in this important hearing.As the world`s largest supporter of biomedical research on drug abuse andaddiction, we have learned much about the behavioral and health effectsof methamphetamine (meth) abuse, as well as effective ways to treat thoseaddicted. I am pleased to be here today to present an overview of whatthe science has taught us about meth?a stimulant drug that can have devastatingmedical, psychiatric, and social consequences. NIDA has been conductingresearch on meth for more than 20 years. During this period, NIDA has beentracking meth abuse and supporting multifaceted research aimed at betterunderstanding how the drug affects the brain and behavior and how we caneffectively prevent and treat meth abuse and addiction. Prevalence of Methamphetaminein the United States Although several national surveys, including the NationalSurvey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), conducted by HHS`s Substance Abuseand Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), and NIDA`s Monitoringthe Future (MTF) survey, do not report overall increases in meth abuse,evidence from emergency departments and treatment programs attest to thegrowing impact of meth abuse in the country. NIDA`s Community EpidemiologyWork Group (CEWG), which monitors drug abuse problems in sentinel sitesacross the Nation, has alerted us to increased meth abuse and associatedproblems in new areas around the country in recent years. In fact, datafrom SAMHSA`s Treatment Episode Data Set (TEDS) show that in 1993 only4 states reported high rates of treatment admissions (i.e., >50 per 100,000population) for meth/amphetamine addiction; by 2003, this number increasedto 18, more than a third of the States. The total number of people seekingtreatment Nationwide increased almost fourfold within a similar timeframe.Further, meth/amphetamine abuse-related emergency department visits acrossthe country have increased more than 50 percent between 1995 and 2002.What Methamphetamine Does to the Brain and Body Methamphetamine is a ScheduleII stimulant, which means it has a high abuse potential and is availableonly by prescription. Only a few clinical indications justify its medicaluse, such as to treat narcolepsy and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder(ADHD), although it is rarely used for the latter. However, it is the illicituse of meth, usually manufactured in ``super labs`` or by ``home cooks``,which is the core of the problem of meth abuse. As a powerful stimulant,

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-09meth, even in small doses, can increase wakefulness and physical activityand decrease appetite. Meth comes in many forms and can be snorted, swallowed,injected, or smoked, the preferred method of abuse varying by geographicalregion and changing over time. In recent years, faster routes of administration(e.g., smoking and injecting) have become more common, amplifying meth`saddiction potential and adverse consequences. Meth acts by affecting manybrain structures but mainly those that contain the neurotransmitter dopamine,due to similarities in their chemical signatures. Meth increases the releaseof dopamine, producing the ``rush`` and/or ``high`` associated with itsabuse. As the most potent of the stimulant drugs, amphetamines elicit moredopamine release than other drugs?three times more than cocaine. This extrasense of pleasure is followed by a ``crash`` that often leads to increasedabuse of the drug and eventually to difficulty in feeling any pleasureat all. Long-term meth abuse can have many devastating consequences, includingaddiction. We know from research that addiction is a chronic, relapsingdisease, characterized by compulsive drug seeking and use, and accompaniedby functional and molecular changes in the brain. NIDAsupported researchhas also shown that meth abuse can lead to cardiovascular problems, suchas rapid heart rate, irregular heartbeat, increased blood pressure, andirreversible, stroke-producing damage to small blood vessels in the brain.Hyperthermia (elevated body temperature) and convulsions occur with meth

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-09overdoses and can result in death. In addition to experiencing deleterious

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-09physical health effects, chronic meth abusers exhibit signs of mental distress,including violent behavior, anxiety, depression, confusion, and insomnia.They also can also suffer from psychotic symptoms such as paranoia, auditoryhallucinations, and delusions. In animals,meth has been shown to damage

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-09nerve terminals in the dopamine- and serotonincontaining regions of thebrain. Similarly, studies of meth abusers have demonstrated significantalterations in the activity of the dopamine system, causing slowed movementand impaired verbal learning (Figure 1). One small study also correlatedchanges in dopamine-mediated function with duration of meth abuse and severityof psychiatric symptoms. Moreover, recent studies of chronic meth abusershave revealed severe structural and functional deficits in brain areasassociated with emotion and linked to depression and anxiety, as well asmemory. However, dopamine cells do not appear to be permanently damaged

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-09in meth abusers, so that with extended abstinence, they achieve some recovery(Figure 2). A recent neuroimaging study of meth abusers showed partialrecovery of brain function in some regions following protracted abstinence,associated with improved performance on motor and verbal memory tests.However, function in other regions did not display recovery even aftertwo years of abstinence, indicating that some meth-induced changes aremuch longer lasting. Additionally, increased risk of cerebrovascular accidentsfrom the abuse of meth can lead to irreversible damage to the brain. DevelopmentalExposure In addition to its known effects in adults, NIDA is very concernedabout the effects of meth on the development of children exposed to thedrug prenatally. Unfortunately, our knowledge in this area is limited.The few human studies that exist have shown increased rates of prematuredelivery, placental abruption, fetal growth retardation, and cardiac andbrain abnormalities. For example, a recent NIDA-funded study showed thatprenatal exposure to methamphetamine resulted in smaller subcortical brainvolumes, which were associated with poorer performance on tests of attentionand memory conducted at about 7 years of age. However, the human studiesso far are inconclusive due to methodological complications, such as smallsample size and maternal use of other drugs. For this reason, NIDA recentlylaunched the first large-scale study of the developmental consequencesof prenatalmeth exposure, which includes seven hospitals in Iowa, Oklahoma,California and Hawaii, states where meth abuse is prevalent, to evaluatedevelopmental outcomes such as cognition, social relationships, motor skillsand medical status. Initial results from this study found that 5.2% ofwomen had used meth at some point during their pregnancy, further indicatingthe need to better understand the developmental outcomes for these children.Our knowledge about the effects of meth use later in development is alsoincomplete. Despite the relatively low levels of meth abuse among youngpeople, we are concerned with any meth abuse in this age group. Becausethe brain continues to develop well into adolescence and even early adulthood,exposure to drugs of abuse during this time may have a significant impacton brain development and later behavior. Additional research will helpus understand the effects of meth abuse during childhood and adolescenceand whether these effects persist into adulthood. Methamphetamine and InfectiousDiseases Methamphetamine is inextricably linked with human immunodeficiencyvirus (HIV), hepatitis C, and other sexually transmitted diseases. Meth

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-09use increases the risk of contracting HIV, not only due to the use of contaminatedequipment, but also due to increased risky sexual behaviors as well asphysiological changes that may favor HIV transmission. Preliminary studiesalso suggest that meth may affect HIV disease progression. For example,animal studies suggest that meth use may result in a more rapid and increasedbrain HIV viral load. Moreover, in a study of HIVpositive individuals beingtreated with highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART), current meth

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-09users had higher plasma viral loads than those who were not currently using

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-09meth, suggesting that HIV-positive meth users on HAART may be at greaterrisk of developing acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) than thoseon HAART that do not use meth. These differences could be due to poor medicationadherence or to interactions between meth and HIV medications. Similarly,preliminary studies suggest that interactions between meth and HIV itselfmay lead to more severe consequences for meth-abusing, HIV-positive patients,including greater neuronal damage and neuropsychological impairment. Moreresearch is needed to better understand these interactions. Treatment forMethamphetamine AddictionWorks Currently, the most effective treatmentsfor meth addiction are behavioral therapies. One particular type, knownas the Matrix Model formeth addiction, has demonstrated efficacy in helpingpeople sustain abstinence. Initially developed in the 1980s for treatingcocaine addiction, the Matrix Model is a 16-week program of group and individualtherapy, and includes elements addressing relapse prevention, behavioralchanges, family communication, healthy environments, and other topics relevantto maintaining abstinence. When applied to meth abusers, the Matrix Modelhas resulted in a sizable percentage of meth-free urine samples at programcompletion and 6-month follow-up. Another behavioral treatment, MotivationalIncentives for Enhancing Drug Abuse Recovery (MIEDAR), uses an incentive-basedapproach to help cocaine and meth abusers with abstinence. It was recentlytested through NIDA`s National Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network, whereparticipants in the incentive condition were twice as likely to achieve8 weeks of documented sustained abstinence as participants receiving treatmentas usual. MIEDAR is currently being developed for dissemination to communitytreatment providers through NIDA`s collaborations with SAMHSA. New Treatmentsfor Meth Addiction on the Horizon Behavioral Therapies. Because no singlebehavioral treatment will be effective for everyone, research into behavioralapproaches for treatingmeth addiction is ongoing. In 2005, NIDA solicitedadditional research applications for developing, refining, and testingbehavioral and behavioral   pharmacological (and/or complementary/alternative)treatments for meth abuse and addiction. We expect that, as with othertypes of addiction, combining pharmacotherapies with behavioral therapieswill yield the most effective treatments. Promising Medications. NIDA-supportedstudies are developing medications for all aspects of meth abuse. For manypeople, depression is a complicating factor in recovery. In fact, imagingstudies show that during withdrawal, the brains of meth addicts resemblethose of depressed patients. Antidepressants may help during these beginningstages of treatment. Bupropion, marketed as Welbutrin, offers promise asan anti-addiction medication for several illicit drugs. Recent study findingsreveal that bupropion reduced acute meth- induced subjective effects aswell as cue-induced cravings. A recently completed Phase II clinical trialwith bupropion has shown it to be significantly effective in reducing meth

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-09abuse in low/moderate users. A follow-up trial is planned. Another clinicaltrial has focused on topiramate, an anti- epileptic medication alreadyon the market as TOPAMAX. A NIDA- supported Phase I safety interactionstudy between topiramate andmeth has been completed, with no safety concerns.A Phase II outpatient study with topiramate inmeth-addicted individualsis underway, in collaboration with OrthoMcNeil Pharmaceuticals. Also, apreliminary study with gamma-vinyl GABA (GVG), a different antiepilepticmedication (approved in Europe but not in the U.S.), marketed as Vigabatrinor Sabril, has shown that half of the treated patients remained drug-freefor approximately 6 weeks, despite living in their normal home environmentswith ready access to drugs. To continue to identify novel anti- addictionmedications for meth and other drugs of abuse, in 2006, NIDA requestedapplications for pilot clinical studies of new compounds whose utilityhas been documented in preclinical models- -so as to establish an adequatefoundation for more extensive clinical research. A new generation of monoclonalantibody-based medications, designed to provide a rapid reversal of meth

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-09effects in an emergency room setting and reduce or prevent long-term medicalproblems, has shown positive results in animal studies. Advances in thedevelopment of technology for large-scale production of monoclonal antibodiesin plants now makes this approach commercially feasible. Combined Approaches.Addiction changes the parts of the brain that affect our ability to think,to control impulses, and to understand consequences. Because drug-impairedcognitive functioning, such as diminished verbal memory and learning skills,can predict treatment dropout and lead to continued abuse and relapse,people undergoing addiction treatment also need medications to help themrecover this functioning and give behavioral therapies the best chanceto work. A ``rising star`` in this arena is modafinil, a medication usedto treat narcolepsy. It appears to improve cognitive functioning in peoplewith schizophrenia and ADHD, and may also complement behavioral counselingfor methamphetamine abuse. Meth exceeds other drugs in its disruption ofcognition, especially attentional control--or the ability to focus andignore or inhibit distractions. Because modafinil has shown early efficacyin cocaine treatment and may have positive effects on executive functionand impulsivity, it is being tested as a potential treatment in meth addiction.Treating Meth Abuse in the Criminal Justice Population Because of the prevalenceof drug abuse among the criminal justice population, NIDA, in collaborationwith NIH`s National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, SAMHSA,and other federal agencies, established the Criminal Justice Drug AbuseTreatment Research Studies (CJ-DATS), a major research initiative, bringingtogether researchers, criminal justice professionals, and addiction treatmentproviders to develop new strategies to help drug-abusing offenders. Aspart of our efforts to combat meth addiction, CJ-DATS is collecting self-reportand biological data on meth abuse and investigating the effectiveness oftreatments in criminal justice settings for those who abuse meth. WithinCJ-DATS, we are also supporting two research protocols testing comprehensivetreatment approaches for juvenile offenders, including those who abuse

In 1690 the Accademia dell'Arcadia, a literary academy, was founded in Rome to combat this style, which had become known as Marinism. The Arcadians sought a more natural, simple poetic style based on classical literature. Pietro Metastasio was an outstanding writer of this group. He wrote great librettos (texts) for operas as well as poetry.

Enlightenment thinkers used reason and scientific thought to look at society, politics, law, and economics in a new way. More than any other Italian writer, Giuseppe Parini embodied the spirit of the time. As thinkers questioned the authority of monarchs and other nonelected rulers, Parini's famous work Il giorno (The Day) masterfully poked fun at the lifestyle of a young Italian nobleman. The book was published in four parts between 1763 and 1801. Parini's Odi (1795; Odes) were written in the same spirit of moral and social reform.

Vittorio Alfieri wrote harsh and bitter tragedies such as Saul (1782) and Mirra (1786). He often used biblical and classical themes and expressed his fierce devotion to freedom and his love of liberty. Another dramatist of the time, Carlo Goldoni, brought new life to the Italian comedy. In the early 18th century most theatrical comedy in Italy was unoriginal and poorly structured. Goldoni introduced fresh and lively plots and characters in his many plays.

At the time Italy sought to unify its separate kingdoms and free itself from foreign rule. Perhaps the most famous writer to focus on the early struggles for unity and freedom was Ugo Foscolo. His stories and poems filled many Italians with a strong sense of nationalism, or love of country.

Romanticism emphasized imagination and emotion-and thus was considered a rejection of the Enlightenment themes of science and reason. The poet and novelist Alessandro Manzoni was the leading figure of Italian romanticism. His novel I promessi sposi (1825-27; The Betrothed) is an example of how romanticism often merged with nationalism. A portrayal of the struggle of two peasant lovers, the book had great patriotic appeal for Italians of the time. The most significant Italian poet of this age was Giacomo Leopardi. His poems are known for their beauty, simplicity, and intensity.

Undergraduate fields of study include liberal arts and sciences, business, education, speech pathology and audiology, and theater arts. The college has a general education requirement that includes courses in math, natural science, humanities, and fine arts. Students also must take interdisciplinary, team-taught courses in three areas: European and North American civilizations; Asian, African, and Latin American civilizations; and Contemporary Society and the Individual. The Whittier Scholars Program enables students to create an individualized degree program, such as urban studies or comparative cultures. Whittier Scholars are relieved of most general education requirements but must complete a senior project and three Scholar seminars. All freshmen take a full year of writing courses. Engineering programs are conducted in conjunction with various other colleges. Whittier offers its students many opportunities to study abroad and is one of the few American colleges to have an exchange program with the People's Republic of China.

A private institution, it was founded by the Society of Friends, or Quakers, in 1887 but ended its religious affiliation in the 1940s. Buildings among the wooded campus range from contemporary styles to red-roofed, white-walled Spanish styles. Among the highlights on campus are a state-of-the-art image processing facility and an extensive collection of aerial photographs of Southern California. A landmark called The Rock stands at the front of campus and is endlessly being painted over by groups of students.

Undergraduate fields of study include liberal arts and sciences, business, education, speech pathology and audiology, and theater arts. The college has a general education requirement that includes courses in math, natural science, humanities, and fine arts. Students also must take interdisciplinary, team-taught courses in three areas: European and North American civilizations; Asian, African, and Latin American civilizations; and Contemporary Society and the Individual. The Whittier Scholars Program enables students to create an individualized degree program, such as urban studies or comparative cultures. Whittier Scholars are relieved of most general education requirements but must complete a senior project and three Scholar seminars. All freshmen take a full year of writing courses. Engineering programs are conducted in conjunction with various other colleges. Whittier offers its students many opportunities to study abroad and is one of the few American colleges to have an exchange program with the People's Republic of China. Graduate students at Whittier can seek degrees in biological and life sciences, education, and law and legal studies.

This represented an 8% increase in prevalence of overweight and a 7% increase in obesity from 1988-1994 NHANES data.3 The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that a total of 1.2 billion people are overweight or obese, and that these numbers are rapidly increasing.2 Overweight and obesity are associated with coronary heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, osteoarthritis, and certain cancers, among other health problems.

Ovo-lactovegetarians avoid meats but consume dairy products and eggs. Vegans avoid all food products of animal origin. References to vegetarians in this paper are to ovo-lactovegetarians, unless otherwise stated, as there are far fewer studies on vegans.

Among these nine studies, three45-47 had fewer than 30 participants. Two other groups reported that either weight or BMI was greater in vegetarians than in non-vegetarians.52,53 Both of these studies had a small number of participants and included "health-conscious" volunteers.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-09Because vegetarian populations may differ from non-vegetarians in their prevalence of non-dietary habits that influence body weight (e.g., smoking and exercise), investigators have controlled for these influences or compared populations with similar lifestyles but different dietary habits. As a group, vegetarians are less likely to smoke, a potential confounder in studies of body weight. However, the weight advantages of vegetarian diets persisted in studies that excluded smokers.16,22,23,26-31,33 Researchers often have studied Seventh-Day Adventists (SDA), taking advantage of the fact that, while virtually all SDA avoid tobacco, caffeine, and alcohol, approximately half follow vegetarian diets, while half consume a moderate amount of meat products, providing a useful population for comparison. Melby31 compared SDA vegetarians with SDA non-vegetarians, and Rouse36 compared SDA vegetarians with Mormon non-vegetarians, both groups that proscribe smoking. In both studies, BMI and/or body weight was lower in vegetarians than in non-vegetarians. Melby31 reported that the BMI of female vegetarians was 4.2 kg/m2 lower than that of non-vegetarians (P < 0.0001) and that the BMI of male vegetarians was 1.8 kg/m2 lower than that of non-vegetarians (non-significant). Rouse36 reported that female vegetarians weighed 3.6 to 7.9 kg (P < 0.01) less than their non-vegetarian counterparts, while male vegetarians weighed 6.3 to 8.5 kg (P < 0.01) less than nonvegetarian males. BMI was 1.8 to 2.2 kg/m2 lower in female vegetarians (P < 0.01) and 1.1 to 3.0 kg/m2 (P < 0.01) lower in male vegetarians compared with nonvegetarians. Fraser20 reported that a vegetarian male SDA weighed, on average, 6.4 kg less than his nonvegetarian counterpart (P < 0.0001), and a vegetarian female SDA weighed, on average, 5.5 kg less then her non-vegetarian counterpart (P < 0.0001). Nieman49 compared dietary status and weight indices in a group of 37 elderly female SDA vegetarians with SDA nonvegetarians, and found that vegetarians weighed 2.5 kg (P = 0.13) less, on average, than non-vegetarians.

In a sample of 183 Dutch men, Knuiman25 reported a gradation to both lower weights and lower BMI from non-vegetarians through near vegetarians (who eat meat and fish products less than once a week), to ovo-lacto-vegetarians and macrobiotic (who avoid most animal products and consume whole grains, beans, vegetables, and fermented soy products) men. In a study comparing the weights of 45 African-American vegans with 143 African-American ovo-lacto-vegetarians, Toohey43 found lower weights among vegans (P < 0.05)

In a cohort of 34,192 California SDAs followed for 6 years, at the end of the study, BMI was higher in those subjects who consumed meat more frequently compared with those who consumed meat less frequently (P < 0.0001).20 These results were calculated for subjects between the ages of 45 and 60 years, but similar results were seen for both sexes and at other ages. Key and Davey55 and Spencer41 used the data collected for the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study to examine the relationship between BMI and meat consumption. Among both men and women, mean BMI was highest among the meat eaters, intermediate among the fish eaters and ovo-lactovegetarians, and lowest among the vegans. These differences in BMI were equivalent to a 5.9-kg difference in weight between male meat eaters and vegans and a 4.7-kg difference between female meat eaters and vegans.

The difference is similar in males and females and is seen in all age groups. In general, the BMI of vegans is lower than that of ovo-lacto-vegetarians, which, in turn, is lower than that of individuals who eat moderate amounts of meat. There were few data on the effect of length of time on a vegetarian diet on body weight or BMI. However, in studies reporting this finding, BMI was lower among those who had adhered to their diet for a longer period compared with those who had adhered to their diet for a shorter period.41,55

In this study, participants were excluded from the analysis if they reported conditions including cardiovascular or heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, or cancer. In a recent study of 55,459 Swedish women, the prevalence of obesity or overweight was 40% among omnivores, 29% among both semi-vegetarians and vegans, and 25% among ovo-lacto vegetarians.34

Some have combined vegetarian diets with other lifestyle interventions. Ornish13 examined the effect of a combination of a low-fat vegetarian diet with a walking program and stress management in free-living adults with coronary artery disease and compared them with a group receiving care from their own physicians. After a year, the mean weight loss was 10.76 kg in the experimental group, compared with a gain of 1.44 kg in the usual-care control group. After 5 years of follow-up, the vegan group maintained a 5.74-kg weight loss.8 In these studies, the effect of diet cannot be separated from that of exercise. Other studies, however, used dietary interventions in the absence of exercise recommendations.

In the course of a crossover trial of the effect of diet on dysmenorrhea involving 35 women (mean BMI = 25.5 Â± 5.2) who were asked not to change their exercise habits, a low-fat, vegan diet without exercise led to mean reductions in body weight of 2.5 kg (P < 0.001) and BMI of 0.9 (P < 0.001) in 6 weeks. Participants with a baseline BMI over 22 lost about 3.0 kg; those with a BMI under 22 lost 1.4kg.9

McDougall59 fed 500 men and women a 5% fat vegan diet for 12 days, which included intensive stress reduction and exercise intervention. This resulted in a 0.96% to 2.26% loss of body weight, approximately 2.5 kg for men and 1 kg for women. Lindahl et al.60 placed 29 hypertensive patients on a vegan diet to assess the effect of the diet on hypertension. The patients were not encouraged to undertake regular fitness training. After 1 year, body weight decreased an average of 8.2 kg (P < 0.001) compared with baseline.

The differences ranged from 4% to 20% (Table 1). Most of the remaining studies found a lower body weight among vegetarians that did not reach statistical significance. Obesity prevalence ranged from 0% to 6% in vegetarians and from about 5% to 45% in non-vegetarians. In short-term, randomized, controlled trials in which the effect of a vegetarian or vegan diet on body weight was compared with control values, weight loss ranged from 2.5 to 7.2 kg, depending on initial body weight. Longer-term, uncontrolled trials have shown that this weight loss generally persists8,60 (Table 2).

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-09The reduced energy intake on typical vegetarian diets appears to be mainly due to higher fiber content and, to a lesser extent, higher carbohydrate and lower fat content.20,22,66,67 The EPIC-Oxford study16 of 5292 persons between the ages of 20 and 89 years indicated that, of all of the components of the diet, dietary fiber contributed the most to the observed age-adjusted differences in BMIs, equivalent to body-weight differences of 3.6 and 2.7 kg for men and women, respectively. Davey76 reported that fiber intake as non-starch polysaccharides was 41% higher in vegan men than in men who ate meat and 36% higher in vegan women than in meat-eating women. The results of a recent meta-analysis suggested that when energy intake is ad libitum, the consumption of an additional 14 g/d fiber is associated with a 10% decrease in energy intake and a body weight loss of 1.9 kg over 3.8 months.68 Dietary fiber reduces energy density69 and influences lean body weight via effects on satiety68 and insulin control.70

Fat, of course, is the most energy-dense of the macronutrients. However, in both the vegan and vegetarian diet, there is also a consistently higher polyunsaturated fat to saturated fat ratio compared with the non-vegetarian 0 diet.20,63,76 Spencer41 observed an inverse association between percent polyunsaturated fat in the diet and BMI. The mechanism by which total fat or the polyunsaturated fat to saturated fat ratio exerts an influence on body weight is unclear. McCarty77 has suggested that since hepatic fatty acid oxidation promotes appetite control and lowers the respiratory quotient, a relative disinhibition of this pathway may play a role in appetite suppression in vegans and/or vegetarians.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/113/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-09The total amount of protein provided in a vegetarian diet, although adequate, is less than that provided in a non-vegetarian diet. However, all essential and nonessential amino acids can be supplied by plant sources.81 Some investigators77,78 have hypothesized that downregulation of insulin and up-regulation of glucagon may occur in response to the relative amount of non-essential amino acids in the diet. Because "high-quality" animal protein has greater efficacy for releasing insulin, and "lower-quality" plant proteins have a greater impact on glucagon, a vegetarian diet may exert a downward effect on body weight. The role of plant proteins in modulating the insulinemic response in vegan diets merits further study.

"Parents should lay down some ground rules regarding cell phone usage when their teens are driving and periodically check to see if their rules are being adhered to. For example, if your child is not supposed to text and drive and they just arrived home from someplace 10 minutes away, there should be no text messages time stamped within that time frame. When my kids are together and one of them is driving, the passenger becomes the communicator on the device."

Students from a girls' high school in Swat, they had just finished a term paper, and their joy was evident as they broke into another Pashto song. About a mile outside the city of Mingora, two men flagged down and boarded the bus, one of them pulling out a gun. "Which one of you is Malala Yousafzai?" he demanded. No one spoke--some out of loyalty, others out of fear. But, unconsciously, their eyes turned to Malala. "That's the one," the gunman said, looking the 15-year-old girl in the face and pulling the trigger twice, shooting her in the head and neck. He fired twice more, wounding two other girls, and then both men fled the scene.

She stared in horror at Malala's body, bleeding profusely and slumped unconscious in her friend's lap, then closed her eyes and started to pray.

Her would-be killers have not yet been caught. But it's clear who bears responsibility. And in the days since the Oct. 9 assault on her, sadness, fury, and indignation have swept the world.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/101/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-10For months a team of Taliban sharpshooters studied the daily route that Malala took to school, and, once the attack was done, the Tehrik-e-Taliban in Pakistan gleefully claimed responsibility, saying Malala was an American spy who idolized the "black devil Obama." She had spoken against the Taliban, they falsely said, and vowed to shoot her again, should she survive.

My father, Salmaan Taseer, was murdered last January after he stood up for Aasia Noreen, a voiceless, forgotten Christian woman who had been sentenced to death for allegedly committing blasphemy. My father, the governor of Punjab province at the time, believed that our country's blasphemy laws had been misused; that far too frequently, they were taken advantage of to settle scores and personal vendettas.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/101/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-10In the days before my father's murder, fanatics had called for a fatwa against him and had burned him in effigy at large demonstrations. His confessed shooter, a 26-year-old man named Mumtaz Qadri, said he had been encouraged to kill my father after hearing a sermon by a cleric, who, frothing at the mouth, screeched to 150 swaying men to kill my father, the "blasphemer." Qadri, a police guard, had been assigned to protect my father. Instead, on the afternoon of Jan. 4, my brother Shehryar's 25th birthday, he killed my father, firing 27 bullets into his back as he walked home.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-10Kinshasa is a modern city in a poor country. Government buildings and business offices line broad boulevards. The neighborhoods of the wealthy have tree-lined streets. The poor live in simple houses of concrete blocks on unpaved streets, while recent arrivals have only makeshift shelters on narrow pathways.

Its river port serves a vast inland region of mines and farms. Export goods, including coffee and minerals, are loaded on trains for the trip around the Congo River rapids to the port of Matadi. There they are transferred to oceangoing ships. Oil pipelines and a highway also connect the two cities. Ndjili airport provides flights between Congo-Kinshasa and other countries.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/106/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-10People have lived along the Congo River for many thousands of years. The modern city of Kinshasa grew from the villages of Nshasa and Ntamo, which were often visited by fishermen and traders. In 1881 Sir Henry Morton Stanley established the city as a trading post. He named it Leopoldville in honor of Leopold II, king of the Belgians, who sponsored his travels.

A railway bypassing the obstacles was completed in 1898, linking Leopoldville and Matadi. Meanwhile, steamboats had begun making regular trips upriver from Leopoldville. As a link between the interior regions and the outside world, Leopoldville grew rapidly. The city had about 23,000 residents in 1923, when it became the capital of the colony known by then as Belgian Congo.

Butterfly Milkweed (Asclepias tuberosa), with light orange to brick  red small flowers, prefers dry sandy soil in full sun, and is  drought tolerant. The pink-flowered Swamp Milkweed (A. incarnata)  grows in moist ground in open areas. Also with deep- pink flowers,  Clasping Milkweed (A. amplexicaulis) is found in dry woodlands.  Common Milkweed (A. syriaca) has pink flowers and grows all over  Virginia in fields, meadows, open woods, and along roadsides. White  Milkweed (A. variegata) occurs in upland woods and thickets.

The plant prefers the dry soil of fields and roadsides. It is common in the Piedmont and some mountain valleys, but rare here in the Coastal Plain. Whorled Milkweed (A. verticillata) is distinguished by  narrow leaves in whorls along the stems. The flowers are greenish-white. This species is also rare in our area and not common elsewhere, according to Hamilton.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-10 Eight species of milkweed occur in Hampton Roads, five are common.  Butterfly Milkweed (Asclepias tuberosa), with light orange to brick  red small flowers, prefers dry sandy soil in full sun, and is  drought tolerant. The pink-flowered Swamp Milkweed (A. incarnata)  grows in moist ground in open areas. Also with deep- pink flowers,  Clasping Milkweed (A. amplexicaulis) is found in dry woodlands.  Common Milkweed (A. syriaca) has pink flowers and grows all over  Virginia in fields, meadows, open woods, and along roadsides. White  Milkweed (A. variegata) occurs in upland woods and thickets.

Purple Milkweed (A. purpurascens) has deep purple flowers, grows in moist woodlands and swampy areas, often in limy soils, but is rare throughout the state.

The plant prefers the dry soil of fields and roadsides. It is common in the Piedmont and some mountain valleys, but rare here in the Coastal Plain. Whorled Milkweed (A. verticillata) is distinguished by  narrow leaves in whorls along the stems. The flowers are greenish-white. This species is also rare in our area and not common elsewhere, according to Hamilton.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/112/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-10Butterflies that survive the long trip find less suitable habitat for overwintering. Eastern Monarchs migrate only to 11 to 14 sites in a mountainous region in Mexico. The oyamel trees on which the monarchs cluster are valuable lumber sources. This year the area occupied by clustering monarchs was the lowest recorded -- 0.67 hectares (1.65 acres; one hectare is 2.47 acres), from a high in 1996-7 of 30.97 hectares, averaging 3.5 hectares during the past 10 years.

Forged from tons of rock, stone, or concrete, a dam's giant wall straddles river valleys to help prevent flooding and chums water to produce hydroelectric power (electricity generated by water-run turbines). "Some even have gated waterways called locks that raise and lower ships," says mechanical engineer Neil Norman.

In the last 50 years, more than 45,000 large dams-at least 15 meters (49 feet) tall-have been erected.

Not only do they strain dam-- builders' pockets, but the environment as well.

Then collected water gets redirected for usage. "Dams have been used since the dawn of agriculture to irrigate fields," says Norman. And they help contribute up to 16 percent of the world's food source. But ironically WCD found the megastructures have also driven between 40-80 million people worldwide-mostly farmers-off their lands.

"Rivers carry natural nutrients downstream," says Norman. Some farmlands depend on these nutrients to stay fertilized, but some dams cut off the nutrients' flow down-- stream. "That happened in Egypt and hurt many farms by the Nile River," adds Norman. Worse, the WCD found most displaced farmers have never been compensated for their losses, resulting in economic hardship.

Conservationists are alarmed over the fish's dramatic decline. Once 16 million strong, the rivers' salmon numbers have fallen to a mere 1 million today. One factor. Salmon spawn (reproduce) in freshwater upstream and make their way down-- stream to live in salty seawater-before swimming upstream again to spawn. "Dams block salmon from swimming upstream," says Norman. "Yet the dams generate a lot of very cost-- effective power for the people in the U.S."

She advocated nutrition and herbal medicines at a time when "heroic," if futile, treatments were often the rule. Her compassion toward ill soldiers was legendary and provided her with the nickname "Mother." Nevertheless, she did not hesitate to stand up to the bureaucratic and occasionally incompetent physician administrators who opposed her. Working in an arena typically off limits for women, she exceeded the bounds proscribed for her sex during the 19th century as a naturopathic physician, humanitarian, and social reformer.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/115/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-10Mary Ann Bickerdyke, nurse, herbalist, and humanitarian, had few equals in getting down to the hard physical labor of caring for victims of war and poverty. During the American Civil War, when treatment methods were both crude and generally ineffective, she stood out as a fervent advocate for attending to both the physical and emotional needs of patients. She fit in squarely with her contemporaries Dorothea Dix and Clara Barton as a forceful social reformer at a time when women were usually relegated to an inferior role. Although her efforts were more narrowly focused than those of Dix and Barton, Bickerdyke became an iconic figure of the Civil War and postwar period through her combination of strong will and compassion.

At age 16 years, she was sent to boarding school in Oberlin, Ohio and according to an early biography may have attended classes at the newly founded Oberlin College, although she did not graduate.1,3 Photographs suggest a dark-haired, plain, unadorned, and serious woman, although her eyes remain strikingly warm and affecting (Fig. 1). Accounts of her casual speech and letters convey a homespun and colorful temperament.

Most contemporary sources state that Mary Ann Bickerdyke began her nursing studies in Cincinnati in 1837 under the direction of the respectable Dartmouth-trained Dr. Reuben Mussey.1,3 However, biographer Nina Brown Baker speculates, without specific evidence, that Bickerdyke learned under the unorthodox naturopathic practitioner Dr. Zimri Hussey at his Physio-Botanic Medical College.3 This argument is supported by the nurse's lifelong focus on herbal and nutritional medicine, areas generally outside the scope of traditional training. She worked as a housekeeper and visiting nurse before her marriage to the widower Robert Bickerdyke in 1847. During their marriage, by all accounts a happy one, she raised three stepchildren as well as her own two young sons and became active in church and civic activities. In 1856, she moved with her family to Galesburg, Illinois, in a vain attempt to improve her husband's failing health. Following his death in 1858 at age 54 years, she hung out her shingle as a nurse and naturopathic practitioner: "Mary Ann Bickerdyke, widow of Robt. Botanic physician. Office and residence."1

On a sweltering June day in 1861, she rode a train several hundred miles to Cairo, Illinois, where Dr. Woodward met and drove her in his personal carriage to the Union field hospitals.

Despite the efforts of volunteer nurse Mary Safford, nicknamed the "Cairo Angel" (who later became a Boston women's physician and feminist), approximately 450 men ill with diarrhea, measles, and typhoid fever were housed in filthy conditions. Their primary caregivers were other invalids who were supposed to function as nurses but were themselves too ill to do the job: "On a cot near the door a human scarecrow sat [with an empty tin water pail at his feet]. . . this man was the nurse, and one of his duties was to fetch drinking water from the nearest storage barrel."3 Mother Bickerdyke immediately went to work, recruiting healthy soldiers to help her clean out the tent areas and bathe and clothe the ill men. She then worked on improving the inadequate field kitchens. Men too ill to swallow solid food were given hot toddies: a mixture of whiskey, hot water, and brown sugar. (A staunch temperance advocate, Bickerdyke despised the recreational use of alcohol although relied on it for medicinal purposes.)

Her first recorded conflict was with a Dr. M_, a civilian contract physician who insisted on keeping up his regular (and lucrative) private practice at the expense of the Bird's Point Army hospital under his charge. Mother Bickerdyke dressed him down in public in full view of the troops. He retreated in an apoplectic rage to brigade commander General Benjamin Prentiss, seething about the "cyclone in calico" who had dared to stand up to him and demanding her ouster. Bickerdyke and her sponsor Captain (Dr.) Woodward met with General Prentiss thereafter. As she later recounted, "I talked sense to him,"1 and she was allowed to stay and continue her work in a semiofficial capacity.

Following the Battle of Belmont, Missouri, a victory for Union forces, Mother Bickerdyke came to the attention of the commanding general, Ulysses Grant. Impressed by her dogged determination and strong character, he installed her as the "matron in charge" at the newly built (brick) general hospital in Cairo-a position usually of symbolic importance only. She assumed substantial authority anyway and ran things in her characteristic roughshod but effective manner, paying particular attention that "her boys" got all the Sanitary Commission's donated supplies that they were promised.

When she complained to the senior military surgeon, he ordered the meddling woman out of his office and out of the hospital. Bickerdyke replied, according to Baker's account, "Doctor, I'm here to stay as long as the men need me. If you put me out of one door I'll come in at another. . . and the patients will help me in. If anybody goes from here, it'll be you. I'm going straight to General Grant. We'll see who gets put out of here" (pp 64-65).3 The doctor wisely backed down.

Several anecdotes relate the unorthodox methods of this dark-haired, stout, and imposing lady. On one occasion, she wrestled a malingering lieutenant to the floor and stripped him of his hospital blouse, undershirt, socks, and slippers in full view of his compatriots,3 enjoining him sharply, "Now, you rascal, let's see what you'll steal next!" (p 481).2 He promptly applied to return with his unit to the front. On another occasion, she laid a trap to catch kitchen workers pilfering her prized stewed peaches. She dosed them with an emetic agent and happened by just as the men received the full effects. "What's the matter, fellows? Peaches don't agree with you? Let me tell you you're lucky! All you got was a little tartar emetic. Next time it'll be "Rough-on-Rats" [rat poison], and then you will have something to groan about" (pp 67-68).3

Women nurses in the Union army numbered less than 20% of the total and were poorly trained, if at all.4 Many of them had no official appointment in the Army hospitals, which meant they received no pay and could be dismissed at will. They were often assigned menial tasks, such as dishwashing, in lieu of meaningful patient care responsibilities. They were, according to "Superintendent of Female Nurses" Dorothea Dix, "objects of continual evil speaking among coarse subordinates," and "looked at with a doubtful eye by all but the most enlightened surgeons" (p 179).4 Dix, well known for her reform of institutions for the mentally ill, had attempted to improve the status of women as military nurses, but she hurt her own cause by insisting on rigid standards of propriety: the woman must be over 30 years old, healthy, "plain almost to repulsion in dress, and devoid of personal attractions" (p 177).4 She also harbored a strong antiCatholic bias and discouraged Catholic orders from sending nuns to the war, an admonition that was fortunately ignored. Despite these difficulties, a number of women distinguished themselves by their contributions and became well known, including Clara Barton, Louisa May Alcott, Mary Safford, Eliza Porter, and Mary Ann Livermore.

Civilian volunteers often contributed their services and included the poet Walt Whitman, whose "Specimen Days" remains a stirring account of the daily struggles against the consequences of projectile injuries and bacteria.5 The toll of death and disease during the 4-year war was indeed staggering with approximately 400,000 Union deaths (from a total troop strength of 2 million) and over 200,000 Confederate deaths (from 750,000 troops).6 Only one-third of the deaths on either side were caused by combat: the majority of disability and death was brought about by infectious diseases. At any given time, an average of 20% of each Army unit was unfit for fighting because of disease. As malnourishment and poor hygiene were the rule, and effective medical treatments were lacking, the provision of attentive, compassionate nursing care became an absolute requisite.

The battle at Fort Donelson produced almost 700 dead and 3,000 casualties on both sides, shocking the complacent publics of both sides and earning Grant the nickname "Butcher Grant." These casualty figures, although later to be dwarfed by those of Shiloh and Antietam, overwhelmed the rudimentary evacuation and field hospital system. Bickerdyke tended the wounded on the ship, and then, dismayed at the numbers still unevacuated, began to assist men on the field. The image of Mother Bickerdyke going from figure to figure in the cold night, silhouetted by her lone lantern while looking for survivors, was picked up by the war press and made her a celebrity of sorts (Fig. 2). Bickerdyke was unimpressed; the end of battle was just the beginning of her work, and she related later that she toiled around the clock and did not sleep in a bed or change clothes for 10 days after the Donelson battle.3

General Grant had decided to move on Corinth, Tennessee to assault General Albert Sydney Johnston's Confederate army in the next step toward Vicksburg and control of the vital Mississippi River. However, Johnston surprised his old Mexican War colleague and attacked unexpectedly at Shiloh River on April 7, 1862. The casualties were horrendous by 19th Century American standards: 1,754 killed and 8,408 wounded for the Union, and 1,723 killed and 8,012 wounded for the Confederates.7 The Confederates left the battlefield the nominal loser without their leader, who had been killed by a Union bullet, although the charge that Grant "lost" Shiloh through drunkenness or neglect cost him command for a time and would dog him for the rest of 1862.

A military surgeon came upon her as she was simultaneously dressing wounds and comforting the wounded, and directing the field kitchen: "Where did you get these articles, and under whose authority are you at work?" Bickerdyke replied, in Livermore's account, "I have received my authority from the Lord God Almighty. Have you anything that ranks higher than that" (p 490)?2

She accepted a formal Sanitary Commission appointment and made numerous speeches on its behalf in Galesburg and Chicago. Her plain-spoken manner induced a flood of donations for Sanitary Commission coffers for the purpose of buying food, clothing, and necessary medical supplies. She next rejoined the Union effort in January 1863 at Fort Pickering in Memphis.

He found fault in her "coddling" of the young soldiers who were convalescing from typhoid and other serious camp diseases. The doctor had finally had enough of Mother Bickerdyke's outspoken methods and confronted her in the presence of fellow Sanitary Commission nurse Mary Livermore, who recorded that Dr. Irwin was "vulgarly angry, and raved in a manner that was very damaging to his dignity" (p 508).2 Bickerdyke retorted in her typical unique voice: "I've come down here to stay, and I mean to stay until this thing is played out. . . . I guess you hadn't better get into a row with me, for whenever anybody does one of us always goes to the wall. And 'tain't never me!" (p 508-509).2 (Dr. Irwin obviously realized the truth of her statement, because he not only backed down, but later became one of her staunch supporters.)

Vicksburg fell to Union hands in July 1863, almost simultaneous with Meade's victory over Lee at Gettysburg. Nevertheless, although the Confederacy's days were numbered, the war was only half over, with many bloody campaigns yet to come. At Vicksburg, Bickerdyke became acquainted with fellow Ohioan General William "Billy" Sherman, the 15th Corps commander who had grown up a few scant miles from her Knox County birthplace. Their admiration was mutual, and when Sherman was tasked with marching his men east into Tennessee and Georgia in late 1863, she accompanied them. She was the only woman he would allow to travel with his hard-fighting troops, and she was one of the few persons of either sex who ever called him "Billy" to his face.

The year 1864 saw her at work throughout Georgia, especially at Kennesaw Mountain and Atlanta. Between rounds of fighting, she and her other Sanitary Commission colleagues-Eliza Porter and Mary Livermore among them-made innumerable trips to Chicago, Milwaukee, and other large cities of the upper Midwest to solicit money and supplies. Bickerdyke also put her efforts toward another crusade, which would become more prominent after the war-care and compensation for disabled veterans.

The war had entered its cruelest phase: Sherman was on his grim march to the sea and did not want his army of mobility to be encumbered with wounded and sick soldiers. Bickerdyke helped evacuate thousands of ill veterans from field hospitals in Atlanta to general hospitals in the north in preparation for this final phase of the war. Her curtain call came when the Army of the Tennessee paraded through Washington as victors on May 24, 1865. Disdaining a chair on the reviewing stand with Dorothea Dix and other dignitaries, she chose to work at an aid tent administering tea and food to fatigued and faint soldiers.3 As an encore, she continued to work for soldiers for many months after the official capitulation of the South.

She became reacquainted with her two sons, raised in proxy during the war by family friends, and continued to push for benefits for disabled veterans. The failure of the boardinghouse in 1869 was a bitter blow, but she threw herself into new crusades on behalf of orphaned children, alcoholics, and female victims of abuse, which took her to New York, Chicago, and San Francisco, among other places.

In 1874, a grasshopper swarm descended on western Kansas, involving Barton County, where her two sons were then homesteading. The famine was devastating; according to local history, "the hoppers would swoop down on a field of corn and when they rose there would be nothing left to denote that there had been anything on the spot except the bare prairie."8 Mother Bickerdyke first went to Galesburg, Illinois, where she collected five rail cars of supplies and sent them west. This was hardly enough for the three counties that were hardest hit, so in the winter of 1874-1875 she traveled to Chicago, Milwaukee, and several other towns and made hundreds of speeches and wrote hundreds of letters. Her efforts resulted in the acquisition of 200 rail cars of food, grain, and clothing, which were shipped to western Kansas and distributed.3 A grateful Kansas state legislature commissioned a portrait of her for the state capitol building, and local residents still remember her as "the savior of Barton County."

Neither physical stresses nor the pervasive sexism of her day daunted her. Perhaps most impressive is how her "cyclonic" personality was leavened with tenderness toward the young men she encountered as victims of battle. Mary Ann Livermore recounted how middle-aged veterans would become tearful when talking about the careful attention they received: "I tell you, it seemed as if my own mother was doing for me, she was so gentle. She. . . nursed me as if I were her son" (p 545).2

Goslin, one of her enthusiastic physician supporters during the war, testified on behalf of a pension for Bickerdyke before the U.S. Senate: "Her services were simply indispensable. I could not have conducted this great hospital without her. . . . She was truly a mother to the hundreds of sick and dying soldiers. Her services were worth more to General Sherman's army during the Atlanta campaign than any brigadier-general in it."9 In 1887, her bachelor son James persuaded her to "retire" at his house in Bunker Hill, Kansas.

He began writing it in the early '90s, just as dial-up modems were starting to ferry e-mails over telephone wires and when, he is embarrassed to admit, a first-class postage stamp cost just 29 cents. As our words are made increasingly of pixels instead of ink, in movies and in life, Yours Ever stands out as a timely, eloquent, and appreciative profile of the letters that make up our mailbag.

Yes, hundreds of letters are sampled here, most by people with starry names like Roosevelt, Freud, and Keats, who, it is no surprise to learn, liked to inject the sinewy adjective "real" into his missives. But Mallon does not choose the correspondence he writes about merely out of "obligation." Better, he says, to let "enthusiasm" lead, a dictum he followed in A Book of One's Own: People and Their Diaries, the sister volume to Yours Ever published in 1984. This loose precept allows him to include lesser-known sets of correspondence, like that between the blind British tailor and blind British seamstress during World War II who loved in word but never met.

This gives Mallon the freedom to talk about letters in whatever order he wishes, and to return to certain writers, such as his seeming favorite Charles Lamb, who compares letter-writing to "whispering through a trumpet."

He notices, for instance, that there are those who write not just to the addressee, but also to themselves, like F. Scott Fitzgerald. Flustered and at times detailing Gatsby-esque schedules in his letters, he cautions his daughter Scottie. He tells her not to be like her parents, though people will be quick "to deck you out in our sins." And as he notes at least once, he kept a carbon of his own letters to see if she responded to all his points. "But the copy's real job," Mallon writes, "was to keep those points, especially the last one- 'Please work- work with your best hours'- face up and available to the man still struggling in the Garden of Allah Hotel."

O'Connor's passing comment about the letters of Gerard Manley Hopkins and Robert Bridges becomes a bridge into their letters, which had trouble keeping "the separation of church and verse." Hopkins kept trying to bring Bridges to God. And so on Mallon goes, as if he is opening nesting dolls every few pages.

Fast forward to 1998, and Kathleen Kelly in Nora Ephron's "reimagining" You've Got Mail sighs the same thing, but not at the post office. In tiny sentences, she types, "I turn on my computer. I wait impatiently as it connects. I go online, and my breath catches in my chest until I hear three little words: You've got mail. I hear nothing.

Fast forward to 1998, and Kathleen Kelly in Nora Ephron's "reimagining" You've Got Mail sighs the same thing, but not at the post office. In tiny sentences, she types, "I turn on my computer. I wait impatiently as it connects. I go online, and my breath catches in my chest until I hear three little words: You've got mail. I hear nothing. Not even a sound on the streets of New York, just the beating of my own heart. I have mail. From you."

He began writing it in the early '90s, just as dial-up modems were starting to ferry e-mails over telephone wires and when, he is embarrassed to admit, a first-class postage stamp cost just 29 cents. As our words are made increasingly of pixels instead of ink, in movies and in life, Yours Ever stands out as a timely, eloquent, and appreciative profile of the letters that make up our mailbag.

Mallon wisely resists the encyclopedist's urge to be exhaustive. Yes, hundreds of letters are sampled here, most by people with starry names like Roosevelt, Freud, and Keats, who, it is no surprise to learn, liked to inject the sinewy adjective "real" into his missives. But Mallon does not choose the correspondence he writes about merely out of "obligation." Better, he says, to let "enthusiasm" lead, a dictum he followed in A Book of One's Own: People and Their Diaries, the sister volume to Yours Ever published in 1984. This loose precept allows him to include lesser-known sets of correspondence, like that between the blind British tailor and blind British seamstress during World War II who loved in word but never met.

The book is built to resist organization and to capitalize on that element of surprise. Its nine categories- including "Absence," "Advice," "Love," and "War"- are "non-categorical," he says. This gives Mallon the freedom to talk about letters in whatever order he wishes, and to return to certain writers, such as his seeming favorite Charles Lamb, who compares letter-writing to "whispering through a trumpet."

He notices, for instance, that there are those who write not just to the addressee, but also to themselves, like F. Scott Fitzgerald. Flustered and at times detailing Gatsby-esque schedules in his letters, he cautions his daughter Scottie. He tells her not to be like her parents, though people will be quick "to deck you out in our sins." And as he notes at least once, he kept a carbon of his own letters to see if she responded to all his points. "But the copy's real job," Mallon writes, "was to keep those points, especially the last one- 'Please work- work with your best hours'- face up and available to the man still struggling in the Garden of Allah Hotel."

Suddenly this turns into talk about Flannery O'Connor, who, while keeping her peafowl and walking on crutches, her "flying buttresses," warrants that the intellect "will cease to be tyrannical" only once it is inside the Church and that, in writing, "everything has to be subordinated to a whole which is not you." O'Connor's passing comment about the letters of Gerard Manley Hopkins and Robert Bridges becomes a bridge into their letters, which had trouble keeping "the separation of church and verse." Hopkins kept trying to bring Bridges to God. And so on Mallon goes, as if he is opening nesting dolls every few pages.

The Brahminical Hindu tradition has been marked by sanctions against women and the so-called lower castes. Power is not based on gender alone; caste, age, and economic status are equally important in determining hierarchies. Caste is a prominent factor, and historically child marriages, abuses against widows, prohibition against divorce, and sanctions against widow remarriage were predominant in the "higher" castes. Lower-caste women had greater freedom in many areas but were discriminated against by the higher-caste men and women. Traditional stigmas associated with divorce and widowhood have been declining among Hindu women in the United States, but vestiges of caste consciousness linger among the Indians.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-13Abstract: Precipitated by the death of the founder's child at the hands of a repeat drunken driving offender, Mothers Against Drunk Driving began as a grassroots, activist movement. With one lone mother in California, the movement expanded to Maryland where another mother and her baby suffered devastating consequences caused by an impaired driver. The movement then gathered exponential steam and expanded across the country. Combining efforts with public health organizations, as well as national, state, and local initiatives, MADD has been able to contribute to the reduction in fatalities caused by impaired drivers. Currently, MADD not only supports the legislation and enforcement of Driving Under the Influence (DUI) legislation, but also supports the families and victims of drunk and impaired drivers, as well as advocating for the elimination of underage drinking.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-13Since its inception in 1980, Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) has had an influential history promoting grassroots advocacy against driving while intoxicated or impaired by alcoholic beverages (Fell & Vosa, 2006). So effective has this organization been, that it is estimated that 94% of all Americans recognize MADD's name and are familiar with its purpose of changing national attitudes concerning driving while impaired or intoxicated (Gallop Organization, 2005). Further, the National Highway Traffic Safety Association (NHTSA, 2004) revealed that deaths due to alcohol related causes had fallen from 30,000 in 1980 to 16,694 in 2002, representing a 44% reduction in alcohol related traffic deaths. Although the number of drivers on the road continued to increase, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2013) reported that by 2010 the number of deaths in alcohol-related automobile accidents had decreased further to 10,228. Even though the link between drinking and driving was uncovered, individual states were slow to respond with appropriate laws to enforce penalties for drivers impaired by alcohol (Fell & Vosa, 2006). Yet, throughout its history of advocacy for sober driving, MADD has impacted the landscape of impaired driving practices in the USA and worldwide.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-13By the 19th century, motor vehicle accidents became problematic in the United States, with alcohol related incidents identified as a contributing factor in accidents (Fell &Vosa, 2006). As early as 1904, the American Association for the Study and Cure of Inebriety staff published the first report on the deleterious effects of combining alcoholic consumption and motor car driving. In 1932, Widmark revealed that there was an association between alcohol consumption and the resultant blood alcohol concentration (BAC). This discovery was quickly followed in 1934 by the work of Heise who then associated the BAC with impaired automobile driving. By the end of prohibition, campaigns against driving while intoxicated competed with the cultural attitude that drinking equated with living the "good life," leading to the belief that alcoholic accidents were mere aberrations and not criminal activity (Lerner, 2011). By the early 20th century, the deleterious effects of drinking and driving were recognized and reported; however, it was not until 1954 when the first convenient device was developed to analyze the alcoholic content of the breath (Borkenstein & Smith, 1961). Nevertheless, even though the evidence revealed an association between drinking, impaired driving, and resulting accidents, most citizens did not yet attach a social or moral stigma to driving impaired (Fell & Vosa, 2006). Rather, motor vehicle encounters caused by drinking and driving were presumed to be operator error or an unfortunate chance occurrence, instead of being a conscious decision to drive while impaired (Fell &Vosa, 2006).

Known as the report on Alcohol and Highway Safety (USDOT, 1968), it further identified the impaired driver as a "problem drinker" and attributed the drinker's actions as the primary cause of these types of accidents. Subsequent to this report, numerous communities began to develop Driving Under the Influence (DUI) enforcement and adjudication initiatives (Levy, Voas, Johnson, & Klein, 1977). Once the cause was placed squarely upon the "problem drinker," local initiatives began to standardize an alcoholic educational training program for the general public and mandatory jail terms for inebriated drivers (Bertelli & Richardson, 2012; Nichols, Weinstein, Ellingstad, & Stuckman-Johnson, 1978). Other initiatives, such as public service announcements discouraging driving while impaired, random highways stops and sobriety checks, and increased public education concerning the dangers of driving while impaired, were developed to prevent drunk drivers or to catch the offenders (Bertelli & Richardson, 2012; Fell & Vosa, 2006). Nevertheless, some opponents to sobriety check points noted these were an infringement of their Fourth Amendment rights (Lucus, 2012). Eventually, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the protection of the public interest superseded the individual's right for protection from unreasonable searches and seizures (Lucus, 2012).

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-13In 1977, three years prior to the precipitating event for MADD, public focus on the problem was brought to light when Doris Aikens, a journalist, reported the death of two Schenectady, New York, teens at the hand of an inebriated driver (Lerner, 2011). Upon investigating the DUI behavior, Aikens revealed that impaired drivers typically only received a judicial "slap on the wrist" for driving while intoxicated, even when that action resulted in fatalities (Lerner, 2011; McCoy, Salinas, Walker, & Hignite, 2012). The judiciary considered these resultant fatalities to be the consequence of just being in the wrong place at the wrong time (Lerner, 2011; McCoy etal., 2012). Aikens' disgust at the DUI behavior and the lack of appropriate judicial consequences spawned the birth of Remove Intoxicated Drivers (RID), a sobriety while driving advocacy group (Lerner, 2011; McCoy et al., 2012).

Brought together by a reporter, Lightner met a mother in Maryland, who was struck by a drunk driver causing the nearly complete paralysis of her 5 month old daughter who was with her (Fell & Vosa, 2006). Subsequent to that meeting and the resulting press conferences highlighting the results of drunk driving, Lightner was inspired to establish a Maryland MADD chapter (Fell & Vosa, 2006; Wilkerson, 2003).

The thrust of their combined efforts revolved around bringing nationwide attention to the drunk driving problem, as well as publically revealing judges and prosecutors who were lenient with offenders (Lerner, 2011; McCoy et al., 2012). Both organizations also staged public protests in order to draw attention to drunk driving issues (Lerner, 2011).

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-13The national consciousness regarding the consequences of driving impaired began to develop concurrently with the foundation of MADD and led to the formation of interventional programs (Fell & Vosa, 2006). Bertelli and Richardson (2012) and Fell and Vosa (2006) revealed that public service announcements led to societal awareness and a demand for more stringent consequences for DUI crimes. This initiative was driven by congressional incentives awarded to states that implemented programs that would decrease the numbers of impaired drivers on the road (Fell & Vosa, 2006). By 1985, traffic fatalities due to drunk driving had decreased to 17,000 (Lerner, 2011). To assist this effort, congressional incentives provided for laws that minimally defined DUI as having a blood alcohol level of .10 or greater and also empowered law officers to confiscate the driving licenses of impaired drivers upon a DUI arrest (Fell & Vosa, 2006). The authors noted that initiatives were advocated, including random road stops and sobriety check points and combining both the judicial system and health care branches to jointly recognize the deleterious effects of driving impaired. The constitutionality of sobriety check points had been established by the U.S. Supreme Court (Lucus, 2012). During this period, the incidences of driving while alcoholically impaired began to decrease (NHTSA, 2004). Additionally, Fell and Vosa (2006) noted that in 1984 President Ronald Reagan signed a federal law that designated 21 as the minimum legal drinking age for the nation.

However, MADD relentlessly continued to encourage grassroots, state, and national initiatives to tighten sobriety laws, create additional legislation, and encourage more rigid enforcement of existing laws related to impaired driving (Fell & Vosa, 2006). In 1996, a congressional initiative awarded grants to states who adopted a BAC of .08 as the legal limit for intoxicated driving. With the assistance of MADD, campaigns were established for states to adopt this new lower BAC limit (Fell & Vosa, 2006).

In order to reduce the number of fatalities and the severity of other accidents that were the result of drunk drivers, President Clinton signed this act into law requiring all states to enact and enforce .08 BAC laws or face reductions in federal highway funds (Manwaring, 1998; U.S. General Accounting Office, 1999). Thus, MADD's comprehensive approach to reform had been proven to be effective. To create global change, MADD's grassroots initiative had attacked the problem from several angles, including preventive efforts as well as advocating for the increase in the consequences of drunk driving (MADD, 2013a, 2013c).

For instance, with the help of MADD, a New York State law enacted in December 2009 mandated a six month Ignition Interlock Device in addition to other sentencing requirements, such as fines, New York State surcharge, mandated Drinking Driver Programs, and the attendance at one Victim Impact Panel (Marutollo, 2010; New York State Governor's Traffic Safety Committee, New York State Department of Motor Vehicles, 2013).

Unlike other sentencing components, this unique panel setting is designed to make offenders aware of the serious- ness of their crime on a personal level (MADD, 2013d). To achieve this, most panels consist of four or more participants and victims, the relatives of people killed in an accident caused by a drunk driver, or past offenders, all of whom present their story to a group of DUI offenders. Participants are given 15 minutes to explain the circumstances of their accidents and how their lives have been affected (Bass, 1989). Even though the offenders have no personal connection with the individuals on the victims' panel, the victims' circumstances are often similar enough to the offenders' accidents to create a jarring, emotional impact on the offenders (Bass, 1989). Offending attendees learn first-hand about the trauma, anger, frustration, emotional suffering, physical pain, financial loss, and devastation that DUI related events cause the innocent victims and their family members (MADD, 2013d).

It is unknown if the attendees ofthat specific panel ever became repeat offenders; however, the point was that at the time of the panel, the offending attendees were notably affected by the experience.

The Victims Services branch of MADD provides a range of services, free of charge, to victims and survivors of drunk driving accidents (MADD, 2013a). The specific services provided by MADD Victim Services include, but are not limited to, a 24-hour telephone support line, advocacy in criminal and civil courts, accompaniment to court, assistance with preparing a victim impact statement, a referral system for victims and survivors to appropriate resources for additional help, support groups nationwide, coordination of a victims' and survivors' social network, and providing supportive materials on applicable topics (MADD, 2013b).

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-13Some research indicates that there are psychological benefits for the victims of DUI-related accidents who participate in programs like the Victims Impact Panel Program (Badovinac, 1994). In 1997, the John Howard Society of Alberta (2013) published a report on delineating the effects of a Victim Impact Statement, which is a written account by the victim of a DUI incident that describes the impact of the crime. The John Howard Society report indicated that these statements are therapeutic for the victims. This was echoed by two other similar reports suggesting that talking and writing about the impact of the crime is helpful for the victims (Hinton, 1995). Victims who are given thÃ© opportunity to share their experience, verbalize their feelings, and contribute to prevention of other DUI accidents reap benefits from the Victim Impact Panels (Badovinac, 1994; Hinton, 1995).

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-13Largely accredited to the efforts of MADD (Fell & Vosa, 2006), public awareness of the adverse consequences of impaired driving has come to the public consciousness over the years (Bellini & Richardson, 2012; Fell & Vosa, 2006). Through its grassroots efforts, MADD has led to the development of national, state, and local laws to curb the societal ravages caused by drunk driving (MADD, 2013a). Further, MADD's involvement led to the development of additional national, state, and local efforts to curb the consequences of drunk driving and spawned many auxiliary groups dedicated to the same cause (Bellini & Richardson, 2012; Fell & Vosa, 2006). Fell and Vosa (2006) noted that through diligent efforts and public education MADD educated the public to realize that alcohol-related fatalities were not just accidental occurrences but were in fact caused by the conscious actions of a problem driver. However, many of these specific efforts remain undocumented and are revealed only anecdotally by individuals who partook in these efforts (Fell & Vosa, 2006). In addition to laws and enforcement, MADD's efforts comprehensively addressed victim rehabilitation and perpetrator rehabilitation.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-13As such, one of the unique features of MADD's approach has been its central focus on victims of intoxicated driving rather than concentrating on the drunk driver (Fell & Vosa, 2006). Perhaps this factor has facilitated the grassroots expansion of MADD by bringing a visceral component to the problem. Nevertheless, Fell and Vosa (2006) revealed that one of MADD's unique strengths has been its multipronged approach to the problem by educating the populace, encouraging the development and passage of laws pertaining to the impaired driver, the prosecution of the drunk driver, pressure placed on alcohol producers and distributers to modify enticing advertising, and for states and communities to institute heavier taxes and limits on the sale of alcoholic beverages. Additionally, MADD advocated jail time for firsttime offenders as opposed to court mandated rehabilitation, which differentiates MADD from other anti-impaired driving organizations.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-13MADD believed that their educational efforts served as a long-term deterrent to the problem of driving under the influence and lobbying for jail terms for first-time DU1 offenders and increased jail sentences for multiple DU1 offenders were short-term deterrents (Bellini & Richardson, 2012; Fell & Vosa, 2006). Influenced by, but not associated with MADD, Students Against Drunk Driving (SADD) and the later evolution to Students Against Destructive Decisions, began to crystalize across the country with its primary emphasis on education for teen drivers (Fell & Vosa, 2006). Efforts to consolidate the two groups could not be accomplished due to philosophical differences between the two groups with SADD being opposed to MADD's ardent position of no tolerance for drunk driving and mandatory jail sentences for drivers convicted of DUI (Fell & Vosa, 2006). Although MADD originally evolved as a predominately white, middle class association, in 1997 the executive board of MADD initiated a diversity program to actively encourage members of other ethnicities and socioeconomic classes to become involved in their efforts (Fell & Vosa, 2006).

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-13Founded in 1985 as a grassroots movement to deter driving while intoxicated, MADD has evolved into an organization which is now the nation's largest non-profit organization dedicated to protecting families from the ravages of drunk drivers and underage drinking (MADD, 2013d). The primary thrust of MADD has become the support of families and victims affected by impaired drivers. Through its concerted grassroots activists' movement, MADD has been attributed to the reduction in fatalities from impaired drivers (Fell & Vosa, 2006; Lerner, 2011; Weed, 1987; Wilkerson, 2003).

Inspiration strikes a Mormon farmboy, the improbably named Philo T. Farn sworth, as he plows a potato field in Idaho.Armed with his new insight, he moves to L.A., finds investors and assistants, and on a shoestring invents television. A corporate giant tries to steal his creation, and a long, expensive legal fight ensues. Farnsworth wins the battle but loses the war, successfully defending his claim to the patent but nonetheless watching most of the credit-and most of the profits-accrue to the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) and its self-aggrandizing chief, David Sarnoff. Farnsworth spends his last years chasing the dream of nuclear fusion, then dies poor, depressed, and virtually forgotten.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-14It's not a bad tale. Drain out the melodrama and sprinkle in some nuance, and you'll find it's actually true. The saga of Philo Farnsworth may have a special resonance in the dot-bust era, as battles rage over intellectual property and corporate turpitude dominates the headlines. Or perhaps it's just a coincidence that two books about Farnsworth have been published this year: Evan Schwartz's The Last Lone Inventor: A Tale of Genius, Deceit, and the Birth of Television (HarperCollins) and Daniel Stashower's The Boy Genius and the Mogul: The Untold Story of Television (Broadway).

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-14Either way, Farnsworth is reentering the inventor-hero pantheon. If he hasn't yet attained the stature of an Edison or a Tesla, he's still better known than, say, Nathan Stubblefield, radio's most forgotten founding father.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-14Farnsworth has even inspired a small backlash, spearheaded by the contrarian journalist Malcolm Gladwell.Writing in the May 27 New Yorker, Gladwell argues that Farnsworth's struggles with Sarnoff "are less straightforward than the cliches of the doomed inventor and the villainous mogul might suggest. Philo Farnsworth's travails make a rather strong case for big corporations, not against them."

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-14Gladwell's argument is clever, accurate in its details, and ultimately silly.

He had to be not just a scientist, but a manager, promoter, politician, and more-and the only one of those fields that he excelled at was the science. The result was constant uncertainty and frustration.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-14Gladwell further emphasizes that television, like other complex inventions, was not created by one man alone. Farnsworth was building on other people's discoveries,just as others built on his. One advantage to big corporations is that they pool the work-and, more important, the patents-of disparate researchers, preventing "legal and commercial gridlock."

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-14What should we make of these arguments?

As he notes, a horde of competing patent monopolies can create a serious bottleneck. On the other hand, assembling those monopolies in a single spot can do the same thing. General Electric, RcA, and other companies deliberately acquired patents to block competition, an end run around antitrust law that evaded serious judicial scrutiny until mid-century. Noble quotes J.E. Otterson of the Western Electric Company, AT&amp;T's manufacturing subsidiary, who in a 1927 memo outlined Ma Bell's strategy to "maintain an active offensive in the ino man's land' lying between it and potentially competitive interests.... Ability to stop the owner of a fundamental and controlling patent from realizing the full fruits of his patent by ownership of necessary second patents may easily put one in position to trade where money alone may be of little battle."

Consider the Texas programmer Evan Brown, who dreamed up a procedure to translate old computer code into new languages and has spent the last six years fighting for the rights to it. Because Brown worked on the idea while DSC Communications was his employer, the company (now owned by the French telecom group Alcatel) claims the rights to it, as per the contract Brown signed when he joined the firm. Brown replies that he first conceived the idea years before he went to work for DSC, that he worked on it during his own time, that it had no relation to his job at DSC, and, most important, that he didn't write it down until after he left the company's employ.

Inspiration strikes a Mormon farmboy, the improbably named Philo T. Farn sworth, as he plows a potato field in Idaho.Armed with his new insight, he moves to L.A., finds investors and assistants, and on a shoestring invents television. A corporate giant tries to steal his creation, and a long, expensive legal fight ensues. Farnsworth wins the battle but loses the war, successfully defending his claim to the patent but nonetheless watching most of the credit-and most of the profits-accrue to the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) and its self-aggrandizing chief, David Sarnoff. Farnsworth spends his last years chasing the dream of nuclear fusion, then dies poor, depressed, and virtually forgotten.

Drain out the melodrama and sprinkle in some nuance, and you'll find it's actually true. The saga of Philo Farnsworth may have a special resonance in the dot-bust era, as battles rage over intellectual property and corporate turpitude dominates the headlines. Or perhaps it's just a coincidence that two books about Farnsworth have been published this year: Evan Schwartz's The Last Lone Inventor: A Tale of Genius, Deceit, and the Birth of Television (HarperCollins) and Daniel Stashower's The Boy Genius and the Mogul: The Untold Story of Television (Broadway).

Philo Farnsworth's travails make a rather strong case for big corporations, not against them."

He had to be not just a scientist, but a manager, promoter, politician, and more-and the only one of those fields that he excelled at was the science. The result was constant uncertainty and frustration.

Farnsworth was building on other people's discoveries,just as others built on his. One advantage to big corporations is that they pool the work-and, more important, the patents-of disparate researchers, preventing "legal and commercial gridlock."

Nearly half of the participants were weight-teased as a child. Participants who experienced childhood weight teasing were significantly more likely to have disturbed eating behaviors now than non-weight-teased peers. As the variety of weight teasing insults recalled increased, so did disturbed eating behaviors and current body mass index. Those who recalled their weight at ages 6, 12, or 16 years as being heavier than average endured weight teasing significantly more frequently and felt greater distress than their lighter counterparts.

Weight teasing may contribute to the development of disturbed eating and eating disorders in young women. Health care professionals, parents, teachers, and other childcare givers must help shiftsocial norms to make weight teasing as unacceptable as other types of bullying. To protect the health of children, efforts to make weight teasing unacceptable are warranted. (Am J Public Health. 2013;103:508-515. doi:10.2105/AJPH.2012.300898)

In addition, previous investigations of weight-related teasing and disturbed eating practices did not use instruments that assessed the full array of eating disorder diagnostic criteria elucidated in the Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV).19 Previous weight-teasing research also has neglected exploration of other salient disturbed eating behaviors, such as emotional eating, disinhibited eating, and dichotomous thinking with regard to food. Increased emotional eating (i.e., eating in response to a mood) and disinhibited eating (i.e., uncontrolled eating) are common among dieters and binge eaters.20,21 Although identified as a common factor among those who have eating disorders,22 dichotomous thinking (i.e., rigid, "black and white" cognitive thinking style) remains an understudied psychological construct.22,23 The rigid dietary "rules" in dichotomous thinking (e.g., good food vs bad food) may help maintain disturbed eating behaviors and increase the frequency of behaviors (e.g., binge eating, purging) following any breach of dietary rules.24 This "all or nothing" attitude toward eating may place an individual at risk for eating disorders.

Eating behaviors. The Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q), 16th edition26 is a self-report version of the Eating Disorder Examination Semi-Structured Interview, which is considered the "gold standard" in clinical practice for identifying those at risk for disturbed eating and eating disorders with DSM criteria.27 This valid, reliable questionnaire assesses cognitive and behavioral psychopathology of eating disorders with 4 scales (i.e., restraint, eating concerns, weight concerns, and shape concerns) and the binge eating disorder module.26,28,29 The restraint scale (5 items) measures attempts to restrict food intake to influence body shape and weight. The eating concerns scale (5 items) measures preoccupation with and feelings toward eating food. The weight concerns scale (5 items) measures feelings toward one's weight. The shape concerns scale (8 items) assesses individual feelings about one's body shape and size. The 7-point rating scale for items on these 4 EDE-Q scales were either number of days in the past month (categorized as 0 = none; 1 = 1-5 days; 2 = 6-12 days; 3 = 13-15 days; 4 = 16-22 days; 5 = 23-27 days; 6 = every day) or "not at all" to "a lot." We computed scale scores with standard procedures (i.e., averaging the scores of items in a scale).26 Higher scores indicate greater eating disorder risk.

The vomiting and medication misuse items were scored from 0 to 6 on the basis of the number of days the individual engaged in the behaviors (categorized as 0 = no days; 1 = 1-5 days; 2 = 6-12 days; 3 = 13-15 days; 4 = 16-22 days; 5 = 23-27 days; 6 = 28 days). We assigned scores to the excessive exercise compensatory behavior item as follows: 0 = no days; 1 = 1-5 days; 2 = 6-10 days; 3 = 11-15 days; 4 = 16-20 days; 5 = 21-25 days; and 6 = more than 25 days. We defined these score ranges because vomiting or misusing medicine 4 ormore times in the past 28 days and excessively exercising 20 or more times over the past 28 days are clinically significant.30,31

The disinhibited eating scale assesses uncontrolled eating behaviors.32 To lower participant burden, the original disinhibited eating scale was reduced from 9 to 3 items by selecting items with the strongest factor loadings in previously reported research.32 For both scales, we computed a scale score by averaging the scores of the scale items. Higher scale scores indicate greater emotional eating behaviors or a greater loss of control over eating.

We used the Perception of Teasing Scale (POTS) to assess weight-teasing history and effect.33 The POTS weight teasing frequency subscale assesses the frequency of weight teasing during childhood (ages 6-16 years).33 This is a 3-item, 5-point scale with responses ranging from never to very often. We assessed frequency of receiving 3 types of weight teasing insults (i.e., being made fun of because of one's weight, being called weight-related names [e.g., "fatso"], and being laughed at because of one's weight). The POTS weight teasing effect subscale evaluates how upset individuals felt after being weight teased. This scale is a 3-item, 5-point scale with responses ranging from not upset to very upset. We calculated scores by averaging the score of all items on a subscale. Higher scores indicated more frequent weight-related teasing as a child or more distress because of the weight-related teasing.

We collected basic demographic information, including current height and weight (which were used to calculate body mass index [BMI, defined as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters]), race/ethnicity, and previous diagnosis of an eating disorder by a health care professional. We also asked participants to recall their weight status (i.e., very thin, thin, average, slightly heavy, and overweight) at ages 6, 12, and 16 years to determine whether recalled weight status at these various time points was associated with weight teasing and disturbed eating behaviors. We selected these specific ages to address the various developmental stages throughout life (i.e., childhood, early adolescence, and late adolescence) and they are comparable to the ages used in the POTS instrument.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-14We calculated internal consistency scores (i.e., Cronbach a) for all instruments. We performed descriptive statistics (e.g., mean, standard deviation, frequency) for all participants and split them by weight-teasing history during childhood (i.e., those who were and those who were not teased) on all demographic characteristics and scale scores. To determine if reported weight teasing frequency and weight teasing effect were related to current eating behaviors, we conducted an independent sample t test on all demographic characteristics and eating behavior scale scores. For the subset of women who were weight teased, we conducted analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), adjusted for BMI and previous diagnosis of an eating disorder, for each eating behavior scale and among the number of weight teasing insults received; when a significant main effect occurred, the Bonferroni procedure was performed. We conducted further analyses comparing recalled weight status at 3 time periods and weight-teasing frequency and weight-teasing effect scores using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and repeated measures ANCOVA procedures. We set significance at P &lt; .05. We conducted all analyses on PASW Statistics SPSS version 19.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL).

The mean age was 19.66 (SD = 1.46) years with most participants being White (55%) followed by Asian (20%), Hispanic (10%), African American (10%), and other (5%). Most participants were either firstor second-year college students (65%) with the remainder more advanced in their college studies. Most participants (72%) had a normal BMI (mean=22.77; SD=4.0) with few being categorized as underweight (8%), overweight (15%), or obese (6%). Approximately 3% had been diagnosed by a health care professional previously with an eating disorder. Nearly half of all participants (45%) recalled being teased about their weight as a child.

To permit the study of the full array of DSM-IV criteria for disordered eating, we examined individual items from the compensatory behavior scale individually rather than by using the scale score. A comparison of eating behavior scales scores between those who were and were not weight teased as a child indicated that weight-teased participants had significantly higher restraint, eating concerns, weight concerns, inappropriate compensatory behaviors (i.e., self-induced vomiting, misuse of medicine, excessive exercise), binge eating, and dichotomous thinking mean scores. Binge eating mean scores were low for both groups indicating that few women engaged in this behavior. However, significantly more weight-teased women (18%) reported regularly binge eating (i.e., at least once per week over the past 28 days) than non-weight-teased women (11%; data not shown).

Nevertheless, significantly more weight-teased women reported regular occurrences (i.e., at least once per week over the past 28 days) of self-induced vomiting and medicine misuse (6% and 5%, respectively) than non-weightteased women (2% and 1.5%, respectively). Regular occurrence of excessive exercise (i.e., exercising vigorously "as a means of controlling weight, altering shape or amount of fat, or burning offcalories" for e 20 days in the past 28 days) was reported by 5.5% of weight-teased and 3% of non-weight-teased participants, but this difference was not significant. There also were significant differences in demographics between weight teased and non-weight-teased participants. That is, weight-teased participants were significantly more likely than non-weight-teased participants to be African American (n = 154; 56% vs 44%), currently overweight (n = 224; 69% vs 31%), obese (n = 88; 88% vs 12%), and with a history of an eating disorder (n = 46; 61% vs 39%).

Of those who were weight teased, nearly all (98%) reported being made fun of and approximately half were called names (49%) or laughed at (57%). Being called weight-related names was the most hurtful teasing insult (mean = 3.87; SD = 1.09), followed by being laughed at (mean = 3.72; SD = 1.20) and being made fun of (mean = 3.62; SD = 1.19). A comparison of POTS scores by BMI category (i.e., underweight, normal weight, overweight, obese), by using ANOVA and posthoc analyses, indicated that weight-teased participants who were currently obese reported being teased significantly more often and being significantly more upset by teasing insults than those at lower BMIs, whereas underweight participants reported being teased significantly less often and were less upset by teasing insults than those with higher BMIs (Table 1). In addition, weight-teasing frequency and weight-teasing effect scores were significantly (P &lt; .05) higher in weight-teased women who reported a history of an eating disorder than in those without.

In addition, all eating behavior scores (i.e., more disturbed eating behaviors), except for selfinduced vomiting and excessive exercise, tended to be significantly higher in those experiencing a greater variety of weight-teasing insults.

ANOVA revealed that, at each time point, those who recalled having a heavier than normal weight tended to have been weight teased significantly more often and felt more upset than those at or below normal weights. Chi-square analysis of teasing insult type by weight status indicated similar findings. That is, being called weight-related names and being laughed at were teasing insults that occurred significantly more often among participants who recalled their body weight to be slightly heavy or overweight at all ages. However, this same trend did not occur in participants who were made fun of at ages 6 and 16 years.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-14We conducted repeated measures ANCOVA and follow-up tests (with control for BMI and history of an eating disorder) to determine associations between participants' recalled body weight (i.e., very thin to overweight) at 3 time points (i.e., ages 6, 12, and 16 years) and weight-teasing distress (i.e., weight-teasing effect scale; Table 3). The Mauchley's test indicated that the assumption of sphericity had been violated (v2(2) = 36.77; P &gt; .05), so we corrected degrees of freedom by using Huynh-Feldt estimates of sphericity ( =Âµ 0.98). There was a main effect for how participants recalled their body weight during childhood and weight-teasing effect scores (F37.30,1295.52 = 1.90; P = .001). Follow-up pairwise comparisons with Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons revealed significant (P &lt; .001) differences in recalled body weights between ages 6 and 12 years and ages 6 and 16 years, but not ages 12 and 16 years. Thus, there was a stronger association between recalled higher body weight at ages 6 and 12 (i.e., between first and sixth grades) and increased degree of distress from weightteasing insults received.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-14The findings from this study indicate that nearly half of young adult women were victims of weight-related teasing as a child, with being "made fun of" the most common insult received and being called weight-related names the most hurtful taunt. As demonstrated by their scores on the eating behavior scales, young women who experienced weight teasing during their growing years were more likely to have disturbed eating behaviors than their non-weight-teased peers. As the variety of weight-teasing insults recalled increased, so did disturbed eating behavior scores and current BMI. Weight-teased participants also were more likely to be African American, to have an above-normal BMI now, and to have been previously diagnosed by a health care professional with an eating disorder. In addition, those who recalled their weight at ages 6, 12, or 16 years as being heavier than average endured weight teasing more frequently and felt greater distress than their lighter counterparts.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-14Of particular concern is that nearly 1 in 25 weight-teased participants reported having been diagnosed with an eating disorder by a health care professional-this rate is 1.5 times that of those who were not weight teased and is slightly higher than the lifetime prevalence rates of eating disorders in the general population (i.e., anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge eating).34

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-14Longitudinal and cross-sectional studies also have reported that weight teasing history is significantly related to body image and disturbed eating behaviors in adolescent, collegeage, and adult females.2,3,13,35-37 For instance, a study of adolescent girls reported that both teasing frequency and teasing effect were significantly associated with body dissatisfaction, eating disturbances, and depression. 36 Results from the study reported here support findings of previous work2,3 and extend them by demonstrating that disturbed eating behaviors persist at least into young adulthood. The study reported here also indicates that eating behavior disturbances are more profound as weight-teasing frequency and ensuing distress increase. However, as others have proposed, race may offer some "protection" from the harmful effects of teasing and pressures to conform to prevailing social norms38 in that African American women in this study reported being subjected to weight teasing most frequently but had the lowest teasing hurtfulness scores. This finding should be viewed with caution because other factors not explored in this study could explain these racial differences in weight-teasing distress.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-14The finding that those who were overweight during childhood suffered the greatest teasing supports the idea that those who "violated" the "thin ideal" social norm are most at risk for being teased.5 Social norms also may play a role in supporting the continued pervasiveness and persistence of weight-related disparagement and prejudice in our otherwise increasingly "politically correct" society.39-44 That is, weight teasing may be perceived as a normative practice by children who frequently witness or experience weight-teasing derision and discrimination. Breaking the vicious cycle of social norms that support weight bias and weight teasing ridicule is critical to protecting emotional, social, and physical well-being.

Administrating the survey online likely yielded more accurate (i.e., less "socially desirable") responses to sensitive items than may have occurred with an in-person administration of the survey.48 The study was limited, however, in that it was cross-sectional and, accordingly, causal inferences cannot be made. Thus, findings from this study only examine associations between recalled weight teasing, recalled weight status, and disturbed eating behaviors. However, this study's findings are consistent with those of longitudinal studies.3,11,14

A further limitation is that examination of other factors that may increase the risk for disturbed eating behaviors (e.g., body image, psychological well-being, media use) were beyond the scope of this study.49 In addition, we did not explore nonverbal teasing insults (e.g., suggestive hand gestures) and source of teasing insults (e.g., family members, friends), but these should be considered in future studies.

She preferred to stay in the classroom at recess and read, her social contacts with female peers lessened, and Mrs. G noticed that Lisa no longer ate lunch. She was observed giving most of her lunch away and nibbling at a small piece of fruit or vegetable.

Forty percent of American women report they are dieting (Eating disorders-Part II, 1997). Recently a survey (Eating disorders-Part II) was conducted with girls in grades five through eight; 31% of the girls said they were dieting, while 9% said they had sometimes abstained from eating. Of these girls, 5% reported they sometimes self-induced vomiting. Dieting also is a common precipitating factor in eating disorders (Glod, 1998). The typical pattern for the onset of anorexia nervosa is that the person begins a diet and then continues to restrict eating after the desired weight is achieved. The person who develops anorexia becomes preoccupied with body shape and weight during this process. Most often, onset begins during adolescence, when the body is undergoing normal physiologic changes; how much these changes associated with puberty contribute to the onset of anorexia is unknown (Glod).

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-14The American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (APA, 1994) provides four main criteria for the diagnosis of anorexia nervosa: The individual is unwilling to gain weight at or above a weight considered the normal minimum for height and age; weight has fallen to 15% below the normal range expected for the individual; the individual has an extreme fear of being fat or adding pounds, even though s/he is below expected weight; disturbances in body image related to either weight or shape of body are present, self-esteem is unduly influenced by the disturbance in body image, or the individual denies the potential seriousness of complications resulting from very low weight. If past menarche, females have amenorrhea for at least three cycles. In younger patients, there may be no weight loss but instead a gain in height without a corresponding increase in weight. In a prepubertal female, menarche may not occur (APA). There are two subtypes for anorexia nervosa: restricting, in which weight loss is accomplished though dieting, fasting, or excessive exercise; and binge-eating/purging, in which the person routinely binge eats or purges or does both during the episode of anorexia (APA).

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-14Bulimia nervosa is defined as having two or more episodes of binge eating every week for at least 3 months and the use of inappropriate ways of avoiding weight gain from bingeing (APA, 1994). A binge consists of rapid ingestion of large amounts of food during a specific period of time that is unequivocally more than the average person would consume in the same amount of time and under the same circumstances. In addition, the individual has a sense of being unable to control the bingeing. The binge is followed by some form of inappropriate compensation, such as laxative use, diuretics, self-induced vomiting, excessive exercise, fasting, or enemas to rid the body of unneeded calories so that weight is maintained. In addition, self-esteem is negatively influenced by the body shape and weight of the individual with bulimia (APA). Bulimia also has two subtypes: purging type, in which the individual uses self-induced vomiting, laxatives, diuretics, or enemas; and the nonpurging type, in which the individual uses other types of inappropriate methods to rid the body of unnecessary calories such as excessive exercise or fasting but does not use the mechanisms associated with purging (APA). Since Lisa lost between 20 and 30 lb, bulimia nervosa can be ruled out as her diagnosis.

Bulimia nervosa tends to occur later in adolescence. Its prevalence varies. Levine (1987) found that between 1 and 6 of every 200 girls will develop anorexia before the age of 21. This means about 1% to 6% of all teenage and college-age women will develop anorexia, and 5% to 8% will develop bulimia (Grothaus, 1998). While boys occasionally develop the disorder, the prevalence of males with anorexia is much lower, about 1.8 per 100,000 (Steiner & Lock, 1998), and approximately 1% to 2% of all boys will be bulimic during their high school years (Levine). Evidence exists that certain athletes are prone to eating disorders, especially if the sport accentuates leanness for improving performance. For example, gymnastics, wrestling, ballet, and figure skating all require leanness for best performance, and anorexia and bulimia are more common among participants in these disciplines (Garner,1993).

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-14The central feature of anorexia nervosa is an abnormally low weight, usually achieved by restricting the number of calories consumed (Garner, 1993). The anorectic adolescent pursues thinness and often is in denial about the seriousness of the weight loss. Typical development of anorexia nervosa starts with a diet or other process, such as excessive exercise, to reduce weight. Often the individual will report having been teased for being fat or wanting to accomplish something that required a leaner look, such as trying out for cheerleading. Once the process of dieting leads to the desired goal, the individual begins to think that maybe just a few more pounds would look even better, so she continues the behavior. Although the individual refuses to eat, s/he continues to have a good appetite, at least in the beginning (Eating disorders-Part I, 1997). In this respect, the term anorexia is a misnomer. The anorectic individual is proud of the ability to lose weight and may feel superior to others who are not dieting. Once cell starvation begins to occur, the person's cognitive abilities may be affected, and the process of self-starvation may make it difficult to reverse the process.

It probably is multifactorial in origin. Three types of predisposing factors interact, resulting in anorexia, according to Garner (1993). These three types of factors are individual, including biological and psychological, familial, and cultural factors (Garner).

In addition, rarely did published research include a control group of patients with other psychiatric disorders. Steiner and Lock (1998) made the same point, stating that since patients in most eating-disorder studies tended to come from specialized eating-disorder clinics, often the studies had a greater number of seriously ill patients than would be found in a representative sample.

People with anorexia nervosa have been described as introverted, constricted, obsessional, compulsive, and reticent (Pryor & Wiederman, 1998). Pryor and Wiederman studied personality features of anorexia and bulimia and found that an inhibited or avoidant personality style was found in about half the adolescents with eating disorders, regardless of diagnosis. Anorectic adolescents demonstrated more compulsivity than bulimic teens.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-14A common theme in the psychology and psychiatric literature was that the anorectic person used self-starvation as a form of self-punishment, with the unconscious goal of pleasing the internalized parent who was viewed as requiring harsh restrictions (Eating disorders-Part I, 1997). Most anorectic females were well-behaved, often perfectionists, straight A students, who were quite sensitive to rejection and tended to be obsessive worriers. Some suggested these young women were responding to their developing bodies, issues of sexuality, and independence when they began to fast. Fast and self-starvation allowed the young anorectic woman to regain a sense of control over herself and others. At the same time, she was able to feel successful and proud of her accomplishments in losing weight, which she was able to do better than others around her (Eating disorders-Part I). Other psychodynamic theories suggested the underlying psychological issues were related to separation-individuation issues within the family (Eating disordersPart I).

Garner (1993) reported that depression was a common comorbid illness in anorexia nervosa. Lifetime prevalence rates ranged from 25% to 89%, depending on which study was read (Halmi et al., 1991; Herpertz-Dahlmann, Wewetzer, Henninghaussen, & Remschmidt, 1996; Herzog, Keller, Sacks, Yeh, & Lavori, 1992). HerpertzDahlmann et al. found lower prevalence rates, but the subjects in their study were 3 to 6 years younger than the subjects in other studies noted. Morbidity for affective disorders typically increases with age (Heebrink et al., 1995), which may account for some of the differences. Rastam (1992) found that the mood disorders commonly found in anorexia nervosa did not precede the eating disorder, although the depression did correlate with anorexia nervosa. Herzog et al. reported that based on their study of a large sample of adults and adolescents, 63% of all patients with eating disorders had a lifetime affective disorder. Patients with mixed anorectic and bulimic features had the highest rates of depression. In contrast, Sunday, Reeman, Eckert, and Halmi (1996) conducted a 10-year outcome study of individuals with adolescent onset of anorexia nervosa. The subjects in this study did not show significant psychopathology 10 years after treatment, unless they also could be diagnosed with a concurrent eating disorder. In thinking about the links between depression and eating disorders, it is important to remember that depressive symptoms can be a consequence of starvation and the concomitant problems that accompany anorexia nervosa. Mood often improved after nutritional status significantly improved (Garner, 1993).

An interview included questions about lifetime self-destructive behaviors and, for most of the patients, questions were asked about drug and alcohol abuse and childhood sexual abuse. Patients answered on a fivepoint Likert scale. Sixteen percent of people with bingepurging type anorexia and 9% of those with restrictive type anorexia had a history of suicide attempts. Anorectics who attempted suicide tended to be older, weighed less, and had been ill for longer than nonattempters. The anorectics who had made suicide attempts tended to have had more treatment failures, greater obsessional thinking, and concomitant drug or alcohol abuse than nonattempters. In Favaro and Santonastaso's study, a history of child sexual abuse was linked to increased self-wounding but not to increased suicide attempts.

The connection has not been confirmed, and some recent studies seemed to negate this as a distinct underlying factor (Eating disorders-Part I, 1997). Herzog, Staley, Carmody, Robbins, and van der Kolk (1993) investigated the relationships of child sexual abuse and eating disorders. Higher rates of comorbid psychiatric disorders were present, with eating disorders in those patients who had experienced child sexual abuse. The rate of child sexual abuse in the sample, however, was not extraordinary compared to the rates for other psychiatric disorders. Perhaps the comorbid psychiatric disorders were more closely related to the child sexual abuse than to eating disorders (Herzog et al.).

(1991) estimated the lifetime prevalence of social phobias at about 25% of patients with anorexia nervosa. Rastam (1992) reported that 35% of anorectic patients had a comorbid obsessive-compulsive disorder. The symptoms of anxiety, depression, and obsessionality were most elevated when the person was most underweight. As weight increased to a more normal level, the severity of these symptoms decreased (Pollice, Kaye, Greeno, & Weltzin, 1997).

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-14There were inconsistencies in the findings of personality disorders as comorbid disorders in patients with anorexia nervosa, according to Garner (1993). Piran, Lerner, Garfinkel, Kennedy, and Brouilette (1988) report that 33% of anorectics who restrict their eating develop avoidant personality disorders, while about 40% of anorexic-bulimic patients develop borderline personality disorders. Herzog et al. (1992) report, however, that personality disorders are rare comorbidities of anorexia nervosa. The use of psychoactive medications in the treatment of anorexia nervosa has been studied primarily with adults who have the disorder, but the use of pharmacologic agents in treating adolescents is relatively untested (Steiner & Lock, 1998). During the acute phase, psychiatric medications are of limited help. In the adult population, antidepressants and low doses of neuroleptics have been used most often. Neuroleptics have been used to combat severe obsessional or psychoticlike thinking and for anxiety. A major problem with neuroleptics, however, is that they may result in binge induction and there is little benefit in using them when compared to control groups (Steiner & Lock).

A few twin studies have been done focusing on discovering a genetic vulnerability for anorexia nervosa (Bakan, Birrngham, & Goldner, 1991; Garfinkel & Garner, 1992; Holland, Sicotte, & Treasure, 1988). While these studies suggested there were some types of genetic factors in the transmission of anorexia nervosa, the nature of the factors transmitted was still uncertain. Data on twins reared together in the same home did not clearly differentiate between genetic transmission and the effects of the environment. It remained unclear if the genetic link was a specific vulnerability or whether the genetic factor was a more indirect link to the disorder, such as a propensity to becoming overweight or to a certain type of personality (Garner, 1993). Hsu (1990) noted there seemed to be a genetic link between chemical dependency and eating disorders, and Root, Fallon, and Friedrich (1986) reported that depression and eating disorders seemed to be related genetically.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-14Eating disorders tend to run in families, as do many other psychiatric disorders. The rate of anorexia among close female relatives of women with anorexia is 2% to 10% (Eating disorders Part I, 1997). When comparing groups of patients with an eating disorder with groups of patients with other psychiatric disorders, the eatingdisorders group had a 20% to chance of having a family member with an eating disorder, while the psychiatric patients with other diagnoses had a 6% chance of having a family member with an eating disorder (Eating disorders-Part I). Halmi et al. (1991) discovered that female first-degree relatives of women with anorexia nervosa had a significantly higher risk of developing an eating disorder during their lifetime. These studies that demonstrated increased familial incidence of eating disorders lent credence to the notion that at least a vulnerability to the disorder was transmitted genetically.

The various endocrine abnormalities associated with anorexia nervosa resulted from disturbances in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis (Garner, 1993). Abnormalities in the neurotransmitters and hormones that usually act to balance energy output with food intake might be one cause of eating disorders. Neural pathways leading from the hypothalamus regulate levels of sex hormones, thyroid hormones, and adrenal cortisol. All these hormones affect body weight, mood, appetite, and the stress response. Serotonin and norepinephrine are two neurotransmitters found in the hypothalamic neural pathways. Serotonin has been shown to be quite low in the starving phase of anorexia; it increases to greater than average amounts, however, when the person's weight returns to normal (Eating disorders-Part I, 1997.

Irregularities in neuroregulatory systems that have been demonstrated in anorexia nervosa may result from the effects of anorexia nervosa rather than cause the disorder (Garner, 1993). The hormonal impact of these irregularities accounts for the cessation of menses or delay of menarche in females with anorexia nervosa.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-14Another theory is that the natural opioidlike substances (enkephalins and endorphins) produced in the brain may influence the course of eating disorders. Higher levels of these substances have been found in the cerebrospinal fluid of anorectic patients (Eating disorders-Part I, 1997). It is known that there is an increase in endorphin release during prolonged fasting. Patients are believed to get a high from fasting. Naltrexone is believed to block the high, thereby reducing the incentive for fasting (Preston, ONeal, & Talaga, 1994). In addition, some patients gain weight when naloxone, a drug similar to naltrexone, is administered (Eating disorders-Part I).

Mothers were described as intrusive, ambivalent, and dominant, while fathers were seen as passive and ineffectual (Vandereyecken, Kog, & Vanderlinden, 1989). Anorexia nervosa was sometimes seen as having a stabilizing effect on the family dynamics. Specific family interaction patterns that were observed included overprotectiveness, rigidity, enmeshment, and family avoidance of conflict. Vandereyecken et al. noted, however, that the family pathology may be the result of the disorder rather than a causative factor.

Young women desiring to be fashionable, successful, and happy exercised and dieted to achieve the thin look promoted by the media. Garner (1993) noted that the significance of cultural pressures on young women to achieve thinness has been recognized only recently. The desire to fashion one's body to fit with the cultural norms was congruent with the cultural norms for accomplishment and self-actualization (Eating disorders-Part II, 1997). Rastam (1992) reported that a strong concern about being overweight seemed to predate the development of anorexia nervosa. The stigma associated with obesity and the ill-designed treatments for obesity have been considered a risk factor for eating disorders (Garner & Wooley, 1991). Huon, Brown, and Morris (1988) stated that anorexia nervosa seemed to have developed a positive public image, and the symptoms of anorexia nervosa were not viewed as abnormal or unusual by the general public.

Cardiovascular, renal, and endocrine systems can be seriously impaired. Dehydration and/or hypokalemia may result in cardiac dysrhythmia and, if untreated, death. Vomiting can produce serious esophageal lacerations, which could lead to hemorrhage as well as major dental damage. The longterm medical complications of anorexia nervosa in youth are well known. Changes in growth hormone, hypothalamic hypogonadism, bone marrow hypoplasia, structural abnormalities of the brain, cardiac dysfunction, gastrointestinal difficulties, significant growth retardation, pubertal delay or interruptions, and peak bone mass reduction are potential complications from anorexia nervosa. Deaths from complications of anorexia nervosa are estimated to be about 6% to 15%, with half of these deaths resulting from suicide (Steiner & Lock, 1998).

More information is needed, however, to make the differential diagnosis. Weight loss may be a symptom of serious medical problems, such as AIDS, Crohn's disease, or cancer. It also may be related to other psychiatric disorders, such as depression, schizophrenia, or social phobias where the phobia is related to eating in public (Glod, 1998). Before making the diagnosis of anorexia nervosa, the clinical nurse specialist (CNS) will need to ascertain if Lisa is experiencing a distorted body image/fear of gaining weight, which is diagnostic of an eating disorder (Glod). In order to further assess Lisa's problem, the CNS will need to develop an alliance with Lisa's mother and gain permission from her to work with Lisa.

This meeting will be the starting point for working with Lisa and her mother. Irwin (1993b) stressed the importance of building trust with not only the patient with anorexia but also the family, especially when the patient lives at home. The mother's statement that she was pleased with Lisa's weight loss could potentially set up an adversarial relationship between the teacher and the mother, since Mrs. G is worried about Lisa. Mrs. G may need some help from the CNS to understand the mother's position before meeting with Lisa's mother. There are various reasons Lisa's mother might have made this statement.

Since Lisa's mother works evenings, she may be asleep when Lisa is getting ready for school, and Lisa is probably asleep when her mother returns from work. Her mother actually may have very little waking time with Lisa. Since eating disorders have increased incidence among female family members, it is possible that Lisa's mother has an eating disorder herself and has not recognized the seriousness of Lisa's problem. Or perhaps, as Huon and colleagues (1988) suggested, her mother had developed a positive image of anorexia and doesn't view Lisa as having any type of problem.

Mrs. G can share her specific concerns, including the fact that Lisa's grades are beginning to slip and that she is falling asleep in class. To support the teacher, the CNS should be available during the meeting but should not join in without the teacher asking the mother's permission to bring the CNS into the meeting. The teacher might suggest having the CNS join them, to provide more specialized information about the possible diagnoses that could be causing Lisa's symptoms.

The patient's distorted body image related to weight is distinctive to the eating disorder. So if Lisa believes she is still not underweight and is still fat, or denies the potential seriousness of her weight loss, the diagnosis will be anorexia nervosa. A few other psychiatric disorders may have somewhat similar problems and should be ruled out. For example, in body dysmorphic disorder, there may be distinct body image distortions that include feeling fat and overweight, but usually without a weight loss. A significant weight loss can occur in depression, but the depressed patient is aware of the loss and acknowledges the seriousness of the problem is that she has fallen far below a normal weight.

However, her 42inch legs -- reportedly insured for several million pounds -- made her name when they featured as the clock hands in David Bailey's Pretty Polly tights campaign. But she was more interested in the workshop than the catwalk, and established herself as one of Tinseltown's most powerful stylists, discreetly dressing a raft of actresses from Nicole Kidman to Sarah Jessica Parker.

It began as a low-key romance; they moved quietly between Jagger's Claridge's suite, restaurants in Paris and beaches in St Bart's before making their relationship public in 2005 at the Golden Globes.

It sounds better for a story" -- and Jagger's penchant for tall models proved irresistible to the gossip columns and she was soon dubbed "the Loin Tamer". Jagger was said to have lowered the floor of his flat by 10 inches to give her enough headroom.

"Do you know how many people I have to get presents for this Christmas?" she would joke.

Displaying Scott's meticulous attention to detail learnt unpicking and stitching Vogue patterns as a girl, her designs were elegant and figure-hugging and became a red- carpet staple.

She was once described as having "the legs of a gazelle and the hide of a buffalo". Questions relating to the Stones were off limits in interviews, although friends put the relationship's longevity down to shared tastes in art and travel: "They scream with laughter at the same things... And she's not at all starstruck," said one, Jerry Hall, Jagger's ex-wife, once said of Scott "I think she's better at dealing with him than I am."

"I think that I have always had composure," she once said. "I don't think that you can be 6ft 3in and care if people talk about you. So I think, just from sheer stature, I developed a kind of shield early on." She said she had never taken drugs, hardly drank until 25 and could make a good Yorkshire pudding. She confessed to being "sports-obsessed" and had Sky TV in her Paris flat so she could watch cricket. She loved travel and her homes with Jagger in Paris and Chelsea, in London, were decorated meticulously with textiles from Laos and embroidery from Turkey.

Her father Ivan worked as a clerk in a DIY store and her mother Lula in a bank. They adopted two other children, Jan and Randy, both still strict Mormons.

Life revolved around the church where she sang in the choir and the walls of the family's bungalow were pasted with Bible quotations. She credited her parents with instilling her work ethic.

On his advice she took her first paycheck and her savings and booked a one-way ticket to Paris to try and make her career as a model. She told her parents she was visiting a friend in New York. She spoke no French and picked her hotel because it was where Jim Morrison died. She changed her name to L'Wren Scott and was soon modelling for Chanel.

Her legs were soon earning her fees in stocking campaigns. Working in London she started a relationship with the millionaire property developer Andrew Ladsky. Moving to LA she briefly married another property tycoon Anthony Brand and began working as a stylist.

She made forays into costume design including for the film Eyes Wide Shut. After recovering from a fall in a pair of Manolo Blahnik heels she decided it was time to design her own dresses and branched in to beauty products, inspired, she said, by the colours of Turner's paintings. Recently there had been reports that her fashion business was experiencing financial difficulties.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/111/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-14The term "marijuana" refers to both the illegal drug and the plant itself. The hemp plant, Cannabis sativa, is a fast-growing (to fifteen feet), bushy annual with finely branched leaves further divided into lance-shaped, sawtooth-edged leaflets. The species was first classified in 1735 by the Swedish botanist Carolus Linnaeus. Both male and female plants produce tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the psychoactive ingredient in the drug. THC collects in tiny droplets of sticky resin produced by glands located at the base of fine hairs covering most of the plant's surface, with the most highly concentrated THC found in the female flower heads. When pollinated, however, the female flower heads produce highly nutritious seeds containing no THC.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/111/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-14Marijuana ranks as the third most commonly used recreational drug in the Western world, behind alcohol and tobacco. It is usually smoked, but it can be eaten or brewed as tea. Responses vary according to dosage and experience using the drug, but most people experience a mild euphoria, or "high." Mood, short-term memory, motor coordination, thought, sensation, and time sense can all be affected. Hunger, known as "the munchies," frequently occurs soon after exposure. The heart rate increases, the blood pressure increases while supine but drops when standing, and the eyes can become bloodshot. The most rapid onset with most temporary effect occurs with smoked marijuana. Unlike alcohol or tobacco, no deaths have been directly attributed to marijuana use alone. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/111/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-14Marijuana has been cultivated and used as a medicine for thousands of years. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved a synthetic formulation of THC, Marinol (brand name of the generic drug dronabinol), that doctors can prescribe legally for the treatment of nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy and the loss of appetite and weight loss characteristic of patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). In addition, both Marinol and marijuana are used to alleviate pain, muscle spasms, neurological disorders, and glaucoma. Many users of medicinal THC prefer to smoke marijuana despite its illegality rather than take the legal pill because orally delivered THC is not well absorbed by the body. Research is being conducted into a patch or some other method of delivering the legal drug more effectively. Previously classified among drugs such as cocaine and morphine with a high potential for abuse, Marinol was moved to a less restricted category that includes anabolic steroids in July, 1999.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/111/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-14Despite the FDA's tacit acknowledgment of the medicinal value of marijuana by the approval of Marinol, marijuana itself is classified as a substance with high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use under federal drug laws, stifling research into other potential medical benefits. Scientific evidence, including the 1990 report of the National Academy of Sciences Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base, strongly supports further research.

Explosions ruptured the Chernobyl nuclear reactor in the former Soviet Union nation of Ukraine, starting a fire on April 26, 1986, that burned for 10 days, resulting in an unprecedented release of radioactive materials into the environment. The cloud from the burning reactor spread numerous types of radioactive materials, including iodine and caesium radionuclides, over much of Europe.

Of those, an estimated 2,200 will die of radiation exposure, according to the report. The Chernobyl Forum is made up of more than 100 scientists from eight United Nations agencies, including the World Health Organization and the World Bank, as well as the governments of Belarus, the Russian Federation and Ukraine.

"By and large, however, we have not found profound negative health impacts to the rest of the population in surrounding areas, nor have we found widespread contamination that would continue to pose a substantial threat to human health."

At least nine children have died of thyroid cancer, but the survival rate of cancer victims is almost 99 percent.

They are not likely to experience decreased fertility, and there is no evidence of increases in birth defects that can be linked to radiation exposure.

They said persistent myths and misperceptions about radiation exposure and health threats have resulted in "paralyzing fatalism" among many residents of the area's near the nuclear reactor.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-15There are three main ways to move your muscles to build or maintain strength. The techniques each have scientific sounding names: isokinetic, isometric and isotonic. There's a little known, almost secret, method of combining two of them to greatly improve the results of your resistance workout. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-15

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-15Despite its technical term, "isotonic" is just a more scientific name for weightlifting. The muscle being worked shortens and lengthens while moving a weight over a range of motion that also involves the movement of one or more joints (a joint is where two bones meet). The movement of the bones strengthens both the ligaments that connect the bones together and the tendons at each end of every muscle that connect the muscle to the bone. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-15Isokinetic exercise usually requires the use of some kind of machine or device. It provides resistance, which changes over the range of motion used in the muscle movement, and is most often done for some kind of physical rehab. This column doesn't concern isokinetic work.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-15There are three main ways to move your muscles to build or maintain strength. The techniques each have scientific sounding names: isokinetic, isometric and isotonic. There's a little known, almost secret, method of combining two of them to greatly improve the results of your resistance workout.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-15Despite its technical term, "isotonic" is just a more scientific name for weightlifting. The muscle being worked shortens and lengthens while moving a weight over a range of motion that also involves the movement of one or more joints (a joint is where two bones meet). The movement of the bones strengthens both the ligaments that connect the bones together and the tendons at each end of every muscle that connect the muscle to the bone. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-15Isokinetic exercise usually requires the use of some kind of machine or device. It provides resistance, which changes over the range of motion used in the muscle movement, and is most often done for some kind of physical rehab. This column doesn't concern isokinetic work.

A recent holiday catalog advertised a " global warming mug" festooned with a map of the world on its exterior. When filled with hot liquid, the map transforms to illustrate the results of a 100-meter rise in sea level caused by global warming . "[W]atch as the familiar coastlines and islands of our planet change to new shapes - or disappear altogether. Hand wash: Microwave safe."

But as science, it is dead wrong. The sea-level rise depicted on the mug exaggerates official predictions of global - warming sea-level rise during the next century by a factor of 100 to 1,000!

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/105/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-15At its simplest, global warming is equated with human amplification of the "greenhouse effect." The greenhouse effect is caused by several rare gases in the earth's atmosphere, including carbon dioxide and water vapor, that are transparent to sunlight but which absorb Earth's heat. Without this naturally occurring absorption of heat, the average temperature of Earth would be around 0Â°F and "our American way of life" would take place inside parkas and igloos.

As a result, so the simple theory goes, Earth is warming beyond the normal greenhouse effect.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/105/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-15This explanation of global warming treats the atmosphere as a static column of clear air. Obviously, this model is too simple to capture the full complexity of our environment, from clouds and storms to the interactions of the atmosphere with the oceans, ice caps, and vegetation. Climate scientists employ intricate computer models known as " global climate models" (GCMs) in an elaborate effort to account for these complexities.

Even when GCM simulations factor in a laundry list of important and obscure climate interactions, the globally averaged result is roughly the same: Increasing amounts of heat-absorbing greenhouse gases will lead to increases in the average global temperature.

If the science of global warming is correct, the past 125 years' worth of greenhouse-gas emissions should have had a measurable effect on world climate, both in terms of atmospheric composition and in temperature changes. Have they?

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/105/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-15Yes. Concentrations of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane (the main component in natural gas, which you may use to heat your home) have increased substantially, about 33 percent and 100 percent respectively, since the late nineteenth century. Meanwhile, global -surface temperatures over both land and sea have increased, on average about 1Â°F over the same period.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/105/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-15Much debate has centered on the details of the warming : exactly how much, where, when, and why. For example, while greenhouse-gas concentrations increased continuously throughout the twentieth century, global temperatures actually declined from about 1940 to 1970. This mid-century cooling has been attributed in part to sulfur pollution created during fossil-fuel burning. According to this hypothesis, sulfates in the atmosphere place a "brake" on global warming by reflecting sunlight. Computer models that incorporate this effect are better able to reproduce observed temperatures.

Despite these and a few other lingering questions, however, virtually universal agreement exists (even among global warming skeptics) that the lowest layer of the Earth's atmosphere has indeed warmed since 1880.

Could the advent of large-scale agriculture and the rise of ancient civilizations have warmed Earth's climate? In his fascinating new book Plows, Plagues &amp; Petroleum (Princeton University Press, 2005), paleoclimatologist Bill Ruddiman plausibly argues that preindustrial methane and carbon-dioxide releases during the past 5,000-8,000 years warmed the Earth by nearly 1.5Â°F - more than the industrial-era warming observed so far.

This sizable warming , in turn, could have staved off the development and advance of new ice sheets in Canada!

What developments are in store for us in the twenty-first century? Below is my personal glimpse into the climatological crystal ball for a baker's dozen of possible consequences, based on a survey of official predictions (see, for example, http://www.grida.no/climate/ ipcc_tar/wg2/009.htm#tabspml ) and discussions by both proponents and skeptics of global warming .

Atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide continue to increase worldwide about 1.5 parts per million (0.4 percent) every year; nitrous oxide ("laughing gas") is increasing at a 1 part-perbillion (0.3 percent) annual rate. Rises in methane concentrations have, surprisingly, slowed to near zero annual growth in recent years. Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are decreasing in concentration as a result of international treaties protecting the ozone layer.

The official predictions of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) are that the global average surface temperature will rise 2.5Â°F to 10.4Â°F during the next century. The wide range of estimates is a product of a variety of different models and scenarios regarding the emissions of greenhouse gases.

A counterargument to Michaels and Balling's claim is that the climate system is in disequilibrium and has not yet adjusted to a majority of the industrial-era greenhouse-gas emissions. In other words, because the climate system reacts on time scales of several decades, another 1Â°F warming is still to come because of the past emissions, not even taking into consideration the twenty-first-century increases in greenhouse gases.

The 2004 film The Day After Tomorrow popularized the notion that global warming may, paradoxically, lead to abrupt cooling due to the disruption of the global ocean circulation via melting ice. During the 1990s, paleoclimatological research confirmed that climate is sensitive to the location and strength of sinking ocean water in the North Atlantic and that melting ice can lead to abrupt climate change by affecting the ocean circulation in these regions. Ocean currents across the world could be weakened and/or displaced, creating global -climate effects. But this phenomenon is not expected to occur any time soon, and in any event the results will not resemble the absurd fantasies depicted in the movie.

In accord with model projections, the highlatitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere have been the epicenter of recent global warming . In the twenty-first century, the warming of these regions may be as much as four times that observed on average across the globe. Meanwhile, the trapping of heat is also leading to warmer conditions at high elevations. As the ice melts and the permafrost thaws rapidly, the flora and fauna in regions such as Alaska, Siberia, and the world's mountain ranges will be seriously challenged. Extinctions are a real possibility. If "worst-case" global - warming scenarios are going to come true during the next century, look for them to occur around the land and seas nearest the Arctic Circle and also around the mountain ranges of the continents.

The official IPCC projections are for rises of 3.5 to 34.5 inches during the next century - a wide range, but minuscule compared to the 3,937-inch (100-meter) rise that has been popularized. The latter doomsday scenario assumes that most or all of the earth's great ice sheets will melt, which, as noted above, is unlikely. Several inches seem nearly inevitable via the thermal expansion of water, however. And a sea-level rise of even a few inches will threaten low-lying regions and islands across the world.

Especially at risk are delta regions such as southern Eouisiana, which are already sinking as the sediments compact and levees prevent replenishment of sediment from floods. Any sea-level rises in these regions are a "double whammy" leading to rapid erosion.

There is no question that warmer ocean waters favor the development of stronger hurricanes when other conditions are favorable. One 2005 hurricane after another - Katrina, Rita, and Wilma - exploded over unusually warm ocean waters. Therefore, it is plausible that in a globally warmed world, hurricanes could be more intense. However, hurricane formation and growth are affected by a number of other meteorological variables that could damp out this effect of global warming .

The public and the popular press often wrongly connect the dots between unrelated weather and climate phenomena. Tabloid predictions of rampaging tornado outbreaks resulting from global warming are a case in point. Severe-weather phenomena such as tornadoes spawn only in situations that combine several ingredients, such as warm moist air, strong cold fronts, and howling upper-level jet streams. Global warming may well create warmer and moister air, but the cold air from Canada will not be as cold, and the jet streams probably will be weaker, too. The end result: If anything, violenttornado activity may be reduced in the twenty-first century as the complex set of ingredients for severe weather come together less often. (However, because of our increased ability to observe tornadoes, reports of weak tornadoes that went undetected in previous decades will continue to increase.)

Blizzards are caused by intense midlatitude cyclones, which in turn are fueled by strong contrasts in temperature. Global warming , because it is most pronounced in the cold high latitudes, actually should reduce temperature contrasts over much of the planet and shift poleward the locations where they occur. Without the clash of contrasting air masses, intense blizzards could be less likely in the twenty-first century. Furthermore, blizzards may retreat to higher latitudes, following the regions of maximum temperature contrasts.

Relatives and friends began to gather in homes once or twice a month on the weekend for worship, study, or meditation. Through these groups, Hindus could pursue the four traditional paths of Hindu practice: bhakti (devotion), yoga (meditation), jnana (knowledge), and karma (action).

A common form of expression in devotion is to sing sacred hymns and songs in honor of the deity or sacred person. These hymns, or bhajans, are in the regional languages of India, such as Gujarati, Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, and Malayalam. They take on a distinct ethnic identity.

They have spread some of the Indian ideas and practices that have significantly influenced American society. However, while many Americans have adopted some elements of Hindu meditation and other Hindu-influenced practices such as vegetarianism, surprisingly few Hindu immigrants practice yoga.

Study groups called Gita mandals (mandais meaning "society") have met in homes for years to study the Bhagavad Gita, the best-loved and best-known Hindu religious text. It consists of a philosophical and devotional dialogue between a warrior named Arjuna and his charioteer, who is really the god Krishna. The poetic dialogue takes place on a battlefield just before a battle between two royal families. It contains Hinduism's basic teachings about the gods, duty, devotion, and many other aspects of the Hindu worldview. The Gita has become a religious classic because, over the centuries, teachers have been able to interpret its enigmatic verses in ways that are meaningful to Hindus living in many times and places. Now they are applying its lessons to the new and different lives that Hindus are leading in the United States.

Enigmatic sayings that embody wisdom, they have inspired Hindu philosophers such as Shankara in the 8th century, Ramanuja in the 12th century, and Mahatma Gandhi, the religious and political leader of India's 20th-century struggle for independence. Philosophically inclined Hindus gather for study sessions to interpret verses of the Upanishads and examine the lessons of previous interpreters.

It shines most intensely on the 11 states that enacted income taxes in the past 50 years. All of them grew more slowly in population and in economic output than the median of the states.

If not, cell phones, tablets and televisions will stimulate the teens' brains, making their bodies feel like it's daytime.

Campbell said he'd like to see the start times flip-flopped. It may benefit elementary students, who he said are more attentive earlier in mornings.

Despite the promising premise, the flat writing, stale characters, and loose ends (the teacher disappears from the story and seems peripheral to the rest of the narrative) do not render this a compelling read. Readers may see a glimmer of hope at the novel's end when it appears McClintock has purposefully misled in order to deliver a twist, however, this is merely a tease and no solid resolution is achieved. Ultimately, this mystery lacks action, suspense, and a verdict, the very elements that readers of whodunits find gratifying.--Laura Falli, McNeil High School, Austin, TX

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/108/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-16Gr 9 Up-- Seventeen-year-old neighbors Rachel Watts and James Mycroft find the murdered body of a homeless man they know. Mycroft is convinced that there is more to the murder than the police believe and persuades Watts to help him investigate. This story is, in part, a homage to Sherlock Holmes and follows all the traditions of a whodunit. However, it's also a tale of a friendship and developing romance of two grieving teenagers. Rachel hates the city of Melbourne and longs for her family's outback farm, lost to foreclosure. Mycroft lives with an uncaring aunt and is still suffering from the loss of his parents in a car crash. The book begins with the aftermath of a fight--Watts and friend Mai mopping up Mycroft's blood. It is a little confusing, as the fight is detailed, schoolteachers and main characters are introduced, and Mycroft comes off as a smart mouth. However, the author develops the characters into authentic, sympathetic individuals while keeping the mystery sustained and the plot moving forward. Somewhat graphic descriptions of the murdered body, swearing, and a subplot of child's sexual abuse make this a novel aimed at older teens . This is a well-written novel that should satisfy confident, thoughtful readers who don't mind Australian slang and brand names.--Michelle Anderson, Tauranga City Libraries, New Zealand

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/103/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-17The current qualitative study of 35 preadoptive gay male couples (70 men) examined gay men's motivations to parent and their reasons for pursuing parenthood at the current time. Similar to heterosexual couples, gay men described a range of psychologically oriented reasons as shaping their decision to become parents. Some of these (e.g., desire to teach a child tolerance) may have been uniquely shaped by their sexual minority status, and others (e.g., desire to give a child a good home) in part reflect their adoptive status. Men named age, finances, and relationship factors, as well as unique contextual factors such as the need to find and move to gay-friendly neighborhoods, as influencing their readiness to pursue parenthood at the current time. Gay men's motivations to parent echo normative life course decision-making processes, but also reflect concerns that are uniquely informed by their sexual minority status.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-17Several of his biographers have commented that Martin Luther King, Jr., was not an "original thinker." Yet to look for originality in King is to misunderstand what he sought to accomplish. His was an effort not to formulate new principles but to reach back into America's past and reanimate its old democratic creed. And in this effort, which he doggedly pursued from the beginning of his public career to its end, he was sui generis. In a time when most of the nation's intellectuals and political leaders were embracing "modern authority" of one kind or another, King was seeking an older, more fundamental authority in the nation's founding principles. In an age when religion was thought to be on the wane-a 1965 issue of Time magazine ran a cover story with the headline, "Is God Dead?"-King sought to stoke old embers of religious conscience. And so if King was not an original thinker, he was certainly an untimely thinker.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-17The locus classicus of King's understanding of America is to be found in his address "I Have a Dream." It is one of the most quoted, best known American speeches of the twentieth century, though its very popularity has also deprived it of the serious attention it deserves. Some scholars have slighted the address, or they have praised it mainly for its "musical" qualities. King himself had anticipated this kind of analysis and warned against it. He once noted of the civil rights movement's "freedom songs" that commentators liked to "talk of their beat and rhythm, but we in the movement are as inspired by their words." If this was true of the songs of the civil rights movement, then it was all the more true of King's speeches.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/104/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-17King's address was delivered on August 28, 1963, on the occasion of the March on Washington for Civil Rights. The march took place against a darkening tableau of racial unrest and violence. The bloody events of Birmingham in the spring of 1963 had convinced President Kennedy that federal legislation was needed to advance the civil rights of blacks. In June, he introduced a bill to bring an end to discrimination in public accommodations, and in a nationally televised speech he defined "the heart of the question" as "whether all Americans are to be afforded equal rights and equal opportunities; whether we are going to treat our fellow Americans as we want to be treated." These sentiments were met with an anger that is difficult to fathom today. Senator James Eastland of Mississippi thundered that Kennedy's legislation amounted to "a complete blueprint for a totalitarian state." In this polarized political climate, it was feared that the March on Washington might end in a blood bath or spark a race war.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/105/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-17It is not easy to stop smoking, either for people or for populations. In 1974 around 45 per cent of British people smoked. By 1994 that had dropped to around one in four. Thereafter rates of quitting slowed. Thirteen years later, when nationwide bans on smoking in public places came into force, about 20 per cent were smokers. Seven years on, that figure is unchanged.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/105/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-17It is well known, but nonetheless worth rehearsing, just how dangerous and unpleasant smoking is. On average it will knock ten years from your life expectancy. More than a quarter of male deaths can be attributed to it, and about a tenth of female ones. Five years ago research for the British Heart Foundation calculated that smokers cost the NHS Pounds 5 billion a year, or a staggering 5.5 per cent of its budget. If you die in a house fire, there's also a strong chance that a cigarette started it. 

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/105/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-17The stalling rate of decline -- even as smokers are forced on to pavements; even as they carry graphic images of their medical futures in their pockets -- indicates a rump of smokers that cannot be scared, shocked or ostracised into quitting. This is their choice, but many would like to stop. Four million people are known to try to give up each year. The NHS has had notable success with the Stop Smoking Service, which involves coaching and counselling, and somewhat less by providing nicotine patches on prescription. The latter appears considerably more successful than the strategy of most smokers, which is to try sheer willpower. Now a study by University College London (UCL) has identified a third way. Electronic cigarettes, or e-cigarettes, have been growing in prevalence for several years and are ubiquitous behind tobacco counters in supermarkets and newsagents. Their use has tripled in three years.

However, given that they only emit water vapour, nicotine and occasionally flavouring, they are far less harmful than regular cigarettes, if even harmful at all. Moreover, as an aid to quitting, UCL found that they were at least as effective as patches provided by a doctor, and considerably more so than willpower or other unmanaged strategies. Given that they are, at present, an unmanaged strategy, this is striking.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/105/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-17All of this raises the question of whether e-cigarettes should be prescribed by doctors. Their use is not uncontroversial. Some feel they normalise smoking, while others insist that they allow former smokers to maintain addictions that they might otherwise have escaped. There is no evidence supporting either fear. Professor Robert West of UCL's Department of Epidemiology & Public Health notes that some health professionals may be wary of e-cigarettes because they resemble the bad old burning weed. There is also, in a manner more sinister, resistance from pharmaceutical companies. The tobacco industry, after all, is not the only one threatened by a cheap, clean, safer alternative to cigarettes. The makers of patches, gums and inhalators have even more to lose.

Certainly, their safety should be investigated and the sooner doctors can start prescribing e-cigarettes to smokers desperate to quit the better. Yet, much as a powerful pharmaceuticals lobby might like it if they were so classified, e- cigarettes are not quite medicines and there is a risk inherent in treating them as such.

While some use them in the hope of ending nicotine dependence altogether, others have no such intention. In either case, they have the potential to represent a formidable advance in public health. This time there really could be smoke without fire.

Eric Knudsen of Florida created the character in response to a call for submissions from the online forum SomethingAwful, said Shira Chess, an assistant professor at the University of Georgia who has researched Slenderman's origins. Knudsen posted the first photos along with a fictional news story on June 10, 2009. He did not respond Tuesday to an email seeking comment. Other writers, artists and programmers later created additional stories, movies and video games featuring Slenderman.

All citrus fruits are considered by botanists to be a special type of berry called a hesperidium. The fruit has a leathery peel and a fleshy, edible interior. The interior flesh, or pulp, is divided into eight or more sections that contain many tiny juice sacs and the seeds. Many of the more popular varieties of citrus fruits are cultivated to be seedless.

Later, scientists discovered that the juice is beneficial because it is rich in vitamin C. It also contains some vitamin A, vitamin B1, and some of the minerals that the body needs. (See also food and nutrition; vitamin.)

In fact, the oldest Oriental literature includes stories about these fruits. The citron was carried to the Middle East sometime between 400 and 600 BC. Arab traders in Asia carried lemons, citrons, limes, oranges and shaddocks to eastern Africa and the Middle East between AD 100 and 700.

From Europe they were carried to the New World by Christopher Columbus and Portuguese and Spanish explorers and were well known in Florida and Brazil by the 16th century. Superior varieties from Southeast Asia arrived in Europe with Portuguese traders in the 16th century. Mandarin oranges from southern China did not arrive in Europe and the New World until the 19th century. Grapefruit, which is probably a mutation from the shaddock, was discovered in the West Indies in the early 1700s. By the 1800s citrus fruits had been distributed worldwide by explorers and missionaries.

The trees begin to bear fruit anytime from three to six years after planting. Citrus trees may live as long as 150 years.

The grower must spray the trees to prevent disease and pest damage. Among the pests are various scale insects. The ladybird beetle was imported from Australia to eat scale insects (see scale insect). Many other beneficial insect predators have been found in recent years. Pest control, now called pest management, uses a combination of natural beneficial predators, farming practices, and chemical sprays to reduce insect pests. Pest management has greatly reduced the amount of chemicals sprayed on citrus groves (see fruitgrowing).

In the United States, which grows about 30 percent of the world's oranges, almost two thirds of the orange crop is grown in Florida and one third is grown in California. Arizona and Texas account for about 2 percent.

In 1944 scientists found a way to concentrate the juice in a vacuum then freeze it without destroying the flavor or vitamin content. The frozen juice became widely available and popular. Now about 70 percent of the orange crop in the United States goes to processing plants that pack canned juice, concentrate, frozen concentrate, orange segments, and marmalade. Byproducts include dehydrated feed for livestock, pectin for use in making jellies, citric acid, essential oils, molasses, and candied peel. ÂChilledÂ orange juice is also marketed. This is fresh orange juice, not a concentrate. California produced the most fruit until frozen juice became popular. Florida then took the lead in production.

Heavy rainfall reduces the need for irrigation there, but many orchards are irrigated during some dry months. The typical Florida orange is thin skinned and its natural color is yellowish or yellowish-orange. Early and midseason varieties are picked from October through March. Florida also grows a variety of orange called Valencia. It is marketed from February through July. Ninety percent of Florida oranges are processed into juice. Also grown in Florida are mandarin oranges and mandarin orange hybrids. These are mainly for sale as fresh fruit. Another name for mandarin is tangerine.

Groves must be irrigated. The seedless Washington navel orange became a major fruit in California after two trees bearing seedless fruit were brought from Bahia, Brazil, in 1873. California groves have a long bearing season. Navels are picked from November through May, and Valencias from March 1 to December 31.

When a grove's crop is mature a crew of pickers is sent in. At packing centers the fruit is boxed or sent to processing plants. If oranges for packing as fresh fruit look green, they may be exposed to ethylene gas, which brings out the orange color.

Until late in the 19th century the few people in Florida who had grapefruit trees grew them only as ornaments. They let the large yellow fruit fall to the ground and rot. In the 1880s winter visitors to Florida tried the fruit and liked it so much that Floridians planted groves and began to ship the fruit north. Today grapefruit, or its juice, is served throughout the worldÂfrom breakfasts to banquets.

The popular varieties are about twice the size of a large orange. The tree can grow to about 50 feet (15 meters), but in groves it is topped at 15 to 25 feet (4.6 to 7.6 meters) and usually has three or four main limbs. The tree has dark, glossy leaves and large sweet-scented blossoms.

Some mature trees may yield 1,500 pounds (680 kilograms) of fruit a season, but the average is 300 to 400 pounds (135 to 180 kilograms). Trees begin blossoming from February to May, and the fruit ripens in about eight months. In Florida, grapefruit must pass state maturity tests before shipment, which begins about October 15. Fruits that mature early in the season often have greenish rinds. Such ÂmaturesÂ are treated with ethylene gas to bring out the yellow color. Popular varieties are grouped as white-fleshed and pink-fleshed. Marsh is the major white-fleshed variety. Redblush and Pink Marsh are the major pink-fleshed varieties.

The juice is canned or frozen; and rind, seeds, and ÂragÂÂthe core and fibrous tissue between segmentsÂare ground for animal feed or pressed into flavoring oil, largely for soft drinks. Grapefruit has few calories and much vitamin C.

Some authorities consider the grapefruit tree to be descended from the shaddock. The name shaddock may be that of a sea captain who introduced the tree to the West Indies. The leaves of the shaddock are like those of the orange but are fuzzy on the undersurface. The flowers are large and white, and the fruit is very large and almost pearshaped, resembling grapefruit, lemon yellow in color, and with a pungent, tart but pleasant flavor. The pulp segments are either pale white or red and shell out easily. The fruit is very popular in Asia.

The lime tree is a native of southeastern Asia, particularly India, and is very sensitive to cold weather. Most of the limes sold in the United States come from plantations in the West Indies, Mexico, and Florida. There are two major types of limes, the Mexican lime, also called West Indian or Key lime, which has a small seedy fruit, and the Tahiti lime, sometimes called Persian lime, which has a larger seedless fruit. These types have been given the scientific names C. aurantifolia and C. latifolia, respectively. The trees do not grow as tall as other citrus trees and they start bearing fruit in the third year. They are fully grown when 6 or 7 years old.

Lemon culture has long been a commercial industry in Spain, Portugal, Italy, Sicily, and Corsica. At present, the leading producing countries are the United States, Italy, Spain, Argentina, Greece, and Turkey. About one fourth of the world's lemons are grown in the United States, mostly in California. Until the cold wave of 1894 and 1895 destroyed its lemon industry, Florida was an important producer. Since that time the great development of lemon culture in the United States has been in the irrigated lands of southern and central California.

A tree may bear as many as 3,000 lemons annually. Most lemons ripen naturally in autumn and winter when market demand is low. Therefore the growers pick the lemons green and store them for sale in the spring and summer. The lemons are picked when they reach a satisfactory size and juice content.

The pulp yields juice containing citric acid. The lemon is a rich source of vitamin C. The juice is used in flavoring foods and drinks. About a third of the California production is processed as juice or concentrates. Lemon juice can also be used as a bleach in the printing of cotton fabrics. Lemon oil, or extract, is obtained from the rind. This extract is used in flavoring and in making perfume and some medicines. The rind can be cooked with sugar to make candied lemon peel. The lemon tree's scientific name is Citrus limon.

All citrus fruits are considered by botanists to be a special type of berry called a hesperidium. The fruit has a leathery peel and a fleshy, edible interior. The interior flesh, or pulp, is divided into eight or more sections that contain many tiny juice sacs and the seeds. Many of the more popular varieties of citrus fruits are cultivated to be seedless.

Later, scientists discovered that the juice is beneficial because it is rich in vitamin C. It also contains some vitamin A, vitamin B1, and some of the minerals that the body needs. (See also food and nutrition; vitamin.)

In fact, the oldest Oriental literature includes stories about these fruits. The citron was carried to the Middle East sometime between 400 and 600 BC. Arab traders in Asia carried lemons, citrons, limes, oranges and shaddocks to eastern Africa and the Middle East between AD 100 and 700.

From Europe they were carried to the New World by Christopher Columbus and Portuguese and Spanish explorers and were well known in Florida and Brazil by the 16th century. Superior varieties from Southeast Asia arrived in Europe with Portuguese traders in the 16th century. Mandarin oranges from southern China did not arrive in Europe and the New World until the 19th century. Grapefruit, which is probably a mutation from the shaddock, was discovered in the West Indies in the early 1700s. By the 1800s citrus fruits had been distributed worldwide by explorers and missionaries.

The trees begin to bear fruit anytime from three to six years after planting. Citrus trees may live as long as 150 years.

The grower must spray the trees to prevent disease and pest damage. Among the pests are various scale insects. The ladybird beetle was imported from Australia to eat scale insects (see scale insect). Many other beneficial insect predators have been found in recent years. Pest control, now called pest management, uses a combination of natural beneficial predators, farming practices, and chemical sprays to reduce insect pests. Pest management has greatly reduced the amount of chemicals sprayed on citrus groves (see fruitgrowing).

In the United States, which grows about 30 percent of the world's oranges, almost two thirds of the orange crop is grown in Florida and one third is grown in California. Arizona and Texas account for about 2 percent.

In 1944 scientists found a way to concentrate the juice in a vacuum then freeze it without destroying the flavor or vitamin content. The frozen juice became widely available and popular. Now about 70 percent of the orange crop in the United States goes to processing plants that pack canned juice, concentrate, frozen concentrate, orange segments, and marmalade. Byproducts include dehydrated feed for livestock, pectin for use in making jellies, citric acid, essential oils, molasses, and candied peel. ÂChilledÂ orange juice is also marketed. This is fresh orange juice, not a concentrate. California produced the most fruit until frozen juice became popular. Florida then took the lead in production.

Heavy rainfall reduces the need for irrigation there, but many orchards are irrigated during some dry months. The typical Florida orange is thin skinned and its natural color is yellowish or yellowish-orange. Early and midseason varieties are picked from October through March. Florida also grows a variety of orange called Valencia. It is marketed from February through July. Ninety percent of Florida oranges are processed into juice. Also grown in Florida are mandarin oranges and mandarin orange hybrids. These are mainly for sale as fresh fruit. Another name for mandarin is tangerine.

Groves must be irrigated. The seedless Washington navel orange became a major fruit in California after two trees bearing seedless fruit were brought from Bahia, Brazil, in 1873. California groves have a long bearing season. Navels are picked from November through May, and Valencias from March 1 to December 31.

Until late in the 19th century the few people in Florida who had grapefruit trees grew them only as ornaments. They let the large yellow fruit fall to the ground and rot. In the 1880s winter visitors to Florida tried the fruit and liked it so much that Floridians planted groves and began to ship the fruit north. Today grapefruit, or its juice, is served throughout the worldÂfrom breakfasts to banquets.

The popular varieties are about twice the size of a large orange. The tree can grow to about 50 feet (15 meters), but in groves it is topped at 15 to 25 feet (4.6 to 7.6 meters) and usually has three or four main limbs. The tree has dark, glossy leaves and large sweet-scented blossoms.

Some mature trees may yield 1,500 pounds (680 kilograms) of fruit a season, but the average is 300 to 400 pounds (135 to 180 kilograms). Trees begin blossoming from February to May, and the fruit ripens in about eight months. In Florida, grapefruit must pass state maturity tests before shipment, which begins about October 15. Fruits that mature early in the season often have greenish rinds. Such ÂmaturesÂ are treated with ethylene gas to bring out the yellow color. Popular varieties are grouped as white-fleshed and pink-fleshed. Marsh is the major white-fleshed variety. Redblush and Pink Marsh are the major pink-fleshed varieties.

Some authorities consider the grapefruit tree to be descended from the shaddock. The name shaddock may be that of a sea captain who introduced the tree to the West Indies. The leaves of the shaddock are like those of the orange but are fuzzy on the undersurface. The flowers are large and white, and the fruit is very large and almost pearshaped, resembling grapefruit, lemon yellow in color, and with a pungent, tart but pleasant flavor. The pulp segments are either pale white or red and shell out easily. The fruit is very popular in Asia.

The lime tree is a native of southeastern Asia, particularly India, and is very sensitive to cold weather. Most of the limes sold in the United States come from plantations in the West Indies, Mexico, and Florida. There are two major types of limes, the Mexican lime, also called West Indian or Key lime, which has a small seedy fruit, and the Tahiti lime, sometimes called Persian lime, which has a larger seedless fruit. These types have been given the scientific names C. aurantifolia and C. latifolia, respectively. The trees do not grow as tall as other citrus trees and they start bearing fruit in the third year. They are fully grown when 6 or 7 years old.

Lemon culture has long been a commercial industry in Spain, Portugal, Italy, Sicily, and Corsica. At present, the leading producing countries are the United States, Italy, Spain, Argentina, Greece, and Turkey. About one fourth of the world's lemons are grown in the United States, mostly in California. Until the cold wave of 1894 and 1895 destroyed its lemon industry, Florida was an important producer. Since that time the great development of lemon culture in the United States has been in the irrigated lands of southern and central California.

The pulp yields juice containing citric acid. The lemon is a rich source of vitamin C. The juice is used in flavoring foods and drinks. About a third of the California production is processed as juice or concentrates. Lemon juice can also be used as a bleach in the printing of cotton fabrics. Lemon oil, or extract, is obtained from the rind. This extract is used in flavoring and in making perfume and some medicines. The rind can be cooked with sugar to make candied lemon peel. The lemon tree's scientific name is Citrus limon.

But when a magazine with the wide readership of Time called her findings and writing "patently unsound," "hysterically emphatic," and an "emotional outburst," then the roots of the criticism, the reasons Carson was so threatening, become clear: she was a woman and she was challenging a cornerstone of industrial capitalism with a passion considered unbecoming to a scientist. The Time piece also trotted out the familiar criticism about the "balance of nature": "Lovers of wildlife often rhapsodize about the 'balance of nature' that keeps all living creatures in harmony, but scientists realistically point out that the balance of nature was upset thousands of years ago when man's invention of weapons made him the king of the beasts. The balance has never recovered its equilibrium; man is th e dominant species on his planet, and as his fields, pastures and cities spread across the land, lesser species are extirpated, pushed into refuge areas, or domesticated."

(25) The National Review called the book "simply a long emotional attack," Carson's approach "emotional and one-sided," an "obscurantist appeal to the emotions." Again invoking the need for "rational" and "scientific" (as opposed to emotional or irrational and sentimental) approach, the review concluded by saying that "[the problem of pesticides] is Burkean, and involves a careful weighing of advantages and disadvantages with due regard to our lack of perfect knowledge." (26) Newsweek wondered about the critics' view of Silent Spring as "innuendo" and having "the quality of gossip." (27) "Her extravagant language ..., her unscientific use of innuendo ..., her pantheism ..., and her disregard for the studies of the problem by her fellow scientists in industry, the university, and government service" (mostly men of course) rendered her study completely unreliable, commented another r eviewer. (28) Even a profile of Carson in Life purporting to be a balanced assessment of the woman and her work could not overlook the implications of Carson's sex noting that "for all her gentle mien, Rachel Carson, 55, who is unmarried but not a feminist ... is a formidable adversary." This phrase suggests that were Carson a feminist she would indeed be a subversive force, for (with a wink to the reader) Life subscribers all know what those women are like. And yet there is also in these words the implication that Carson's unmarried status is itself an expression of some deficiency, that were she married, none of this controversy would have developed. Presumably she would have instead been practicing home economics and recognizing the overwhelming benefits of pesticide-enhanced agricultural bounty for the kitchen. There is, in fact, no evidence to suggest Carson openly advocated for women's rights, although her own struggle with the scientific establishment served as a feminist statement. By the second page of the profile Carson had morphed into a pesky gadfly, a "good indignant crusader." Finally, the article concluded, like troublesome Mother Nature herself, "Hurricane Rachel" must be endured, becalmed, and then "the real dangers to public health [could] be evaluated, and then controlled by skilled medical men."

There were none of the usual press release photographs of a white-coated notable scientist in the lab looking authoritative or the dauntless field researcher above the volcano's mouth. Instead, Carson was almost always photographed with her cat or sitting in the woods surrounded by children gesturing at the natural wonders of the world. Only occasionally did a photo of her at a microscope appear. By implication, these photos located Carson in the world of the school marm, not the world of science. She was a teacher-to some a subversive, dangerous one-but not someone who was engaged in meaningful scientific research. (30)

An early collaborator on Silent Spring, Edwin Diamond, described how he simply could not work with a woman who let emotion interfere with accuracy and whose final product relied on the same shock techniques and distortions employed by Joseph McCarthy. (31) The story, "Life-Giving Spray" (featuring the obligatory photograph of Carson as sentimental bird watcher), appeared in the quintessential male magazine, Sports Illustrated, and concluded that one year after Carson's frightening indictment wildlife seemed more abundant than ever, and was, in fact, aided by pesticide use.

In a widely distributed speech of January 1963, the president of the Nutrition Foundation, C.G. King, like Frederick Stare and others cited above, condemned Carson as a fellow traveler with all of the fringe elements of society: "Food faddists, health quacks, and special interest groups are promoting her book as if it were scientifically irreproachable and written by a scientist. Neither is true . . . and [Carson] misses the very essence of science in not being objective either in citing the evidence or in its interpretation." (33) The frequently interviewed Robert H. White-Stevens, whose British accent and grandfatherly appearance evidently conferred upon him a trustworthiness unmerited by his intemperate remarks, proved to be the king of anti-Carson sound bites with variations on the following characterization of Silent Spring: "Her book is littered with crass assumptions and gross misinterpretations, misquotations, and misunderstandings, clearly calculated to mislead the uninformed. . . . Her book will come to be regarded in time as a gross distortion of the actual facts, essentially unsupported by either scientific experimental evidence or practical experience in the field." (34) For these men, whose power in shaping society through expert scientific advice hung on their credibility as both protectors of the public interest and exemplars of "true" science, Rachel Carson's conclusions arid analysis were terrifying. Carson's critics-mostly men, mostly white, mostly affiliated with some bureaucratic institution-recognized the general public's willingness to accept science as it was being practiced as the ultimate authority. They therefore took two approaches to discrediting her, both of which often led the reader to make inferences about how gender inflected her science and both of which sought to shore up the foundations of science that Carson's critique of moder nity had shaken. Carson's critics tried to reassure the world that even if some of what Carson alleged was true, the mistakes resulted from misapplication, not misguided science. Science, they argued, was almost solely responsible for the extraordinary standard of living Americans were experiencing by the early 1960s. To heed Carson's warnings would be tantamount to killing the goose that was laying the golden egg. Since the Progressive Era when the federal government had begun regulating society in earnest for the first time, the burgeoning American middle class had been willing to accept safety regulations only to the extent that such regulations did not incur large increases in the price of consumer goods. As was the case with the meatpacking industry in the first decade of the twentieth century following the publication of Upton Sinclair's The Jungle, those who stood to profit directly from the heavy use of pesticides responded to Silent Spring with the consumer's wallet in mind, thereby striking a putati ve balance-if it can be called such a thing-between public health safety and affordability. "[Because of pesticides] today's American housewives have the widest choice of fruits and vegetables, and meats and dairy-at prices to fit their budgets," characterizes this rhetoric. (35)

Although Carson's job in Silent Spring was largely that of a synthesizer, her conclusions pointed to the practice of a profoundly different relationship between humans and nature than that which obtained in early 1960s' America. Carson avoided making prescriptions that amounted to a call for the over-throw of the existing order. Her persistent invocation of "balance" and the rhetoric she employed in advocating a change in the application of science amounted to a subversive act, however. This challenge to the order of things, even when it was not a conscious one, inspired the modern environmental movement and under-girds much of what is now called "ecofeminism." For the remainder of this article I will examine a few passages from Silent Spring that illustrate the radical nature of Carson's critique and briefly outline both her legacy and the legacy of the public relations campaign against her.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/101/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-19In his essay on the politics of nature in Silent Spring, Yaakov Garb argues that Carson was not really very radical. She was, he contends, content to practice realpolitik to a certain degree; that is, she deliberately avoided connecting the injustices of the social environment that to a certain extent preordained the injustices to the natural environment. To argue that capitalism generally, not merely the corporate greed of chemical manufacturers, was responsible for irresponsible science was not, obviously, Carson's agenda. But, as Garb points out, Our Synthetic Environment, a book by the anarchist Murray Bookchin (writing pseudonymously as Lewis Herber), published only months before Silent Spring and making the same indictment against pesticides using many of the same sources, received little attention. Why? Because Bookchin's polemic viewed pesticides merely as a symptom of an economic system that was pathological to its core. Without social justice, he argued, there could be no environmental justice. He h oped to leverage a popular overthrow of the status quo through his expose of government and corporate complicity in the poisoning of the environment and people. Bookchin's critique of society was simply unpalatable to even many of those "fringe" groups with whom Carson was speciously associated. Garb sees Silent Spring as a far less radical critique of society than Bookchin's. Carson, Garb contends, invoked the "balance of nature" because it at once resonated with an antimodern impulse that resides in many denizens of late-twentieth-century society and because it was sufficiently vague not to be threatening to most of society. He writes:

Their multiple connotations and self-evident (thus unexamined) definition within the community that shares them enable protean versatility. We add great force to any argument by adducing the "natural" to it, so long as no one asks carefully what we mean by the term. If they do, it will often turn out that nature (and its cognates) are not pre-existing, ontologically firm objects or conditions in the natural world, but a reification of human criteria and definitions.

In the first pages of Silent Spring-the "Fable for Tomorrow" that so many critics held up as evidence that Carson was a storyteller and nothing more-she evoked a world which, having been treated as a machine more inorganic than vital for so many centuries, has died. "No witchcraft . . . had silenced the rebirth of new life in this stricken world," Carson wrote, "The people had done it themselves." (37) The scientists, mostly, had done it, with homeowners and farmers abetting, largely unaware of what they were doing. Time and again Carson refers to man's quest for dominion over nature: his "assaults on the natural world" (16), his "[procession] toward his announced goal of the conquest of nature" (83), his tearing of "the earth's green mantle" (64).

At various stages of the writing process Carson wanted to call her book "Control of Nature" and "Man against the Earth." (38) And she indicts the dictatorial nature of science and its star chamber of practitioners who make decisions that effect everyone, destroying a part of the world without consent. Someone had appointed himself God. "Who has made the decision that sets in motion these chains of poisonings, this ever-widening wave of death that spreads out, like ripples when a pebble is dropped into a still pond?" She asked: "Who has decided-who has the right to decide-for the countless legions of people who were not consulted that the supreme value is a world without insects, even though it be also a sterile world ungraced by the curving wing of a bird in flight? The decision is that of the authoritarian...; he has made it during a moment of inattention by millions to whom beauty and the ordered world of nature still have a meaning that is deep and imperative" (119). "Man with a spray gun" is a phrase Carson employs to describe the militaristic fervor with which pesticide users have carried out their project to eradicate all insects. This "man with a spray gun" has ignored the balance of nature, destroying as pests insects which preyed on insects even more destructive to the sculpted environment of humans. There are laws more fundamental than Bacon's and Newton's. Carson argued that "[t]he balance of nature...is a complex, precise, and highly integrated system of relationships between living things which cannot safely be ignored any more than the law of gravity can be defied with impunity by a man perched on the edge of a cliff.... Man, too, is part of this balance" (218).

But in a way more pointed than anyone before her she identified the most profound consequence of humanity's tampering with this balance: humans themselves. For Carson, one of the most disturbing aspects of the chemical world of the postwar era was how it had compromised future generations. "Chemicals occur in the mother's milk and probably in the tissues of the unborn child" (24), she wrote. We had engaged in an experiment with no control group, Carson worried, a terribly dangerous game. The illusion that human beings, by virtue of their power to manipulate nature, were immune to the diffusion of toxins into the environment was no longer tenable after Silent Spring.

A presidential commission and congressional investigation into the dangers posed by pesticides led to stricter guidelines about the testing, labeling, and application of pesticides. The road from Silent Spring led directly to the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency. In the years since the publication of Silent Spring, other scientists have largely corroborated Carson's assertions about the damage chemical pesticides do to the environment. (39) In spite of this, the addiction of the industrialized world and, increasingly, the developing world, to powerful poisons for eradicating the "pests" that feast on the vast acreages of industrial monoculture is as strong as ever. Perhaps even more troubling has been the ever-growing acceptance of genetically engineered agricultural products, many of which are genetically engineered to resist herbicides. The continued complication of agriculture makes the production of food increasingly reliant on corporate interests, whose primary interest, of course, is profit. Although some writers have read Carson as ignoring this element of the pesticide problem, they have overlooked several searing indictments of corporate greed. "[This] is ... an era dominated by industry," Carson wrote in the second chapter of Silent Spring, "in which the right to make a dollar at whatever cost is seldom challenged. When the public protests, confronted with some obvious evidence of damaging results of pesticide applications, it is fed little tranquilizing pills of half truth" (23).

Despite the initial uproar over pesticides there was a marked decline of the general public's interest in the issue by 1965. (40) Environmental activists kept the issue on the table but attention soon shifted to other social problems: student unrest, the Vietnam War, racial tensions. Although chemical pollution of the environment remained (and remains) a very serious problem, the loudest advocates of curtailing the use of pesticides were, ironically, the much disparaged "food faddists," organic gardeners and farmers, and grassroots activists whose own lives had been directly affected by environmental toxins. (41)

(22), Rachel Carson asked in 1962. When her predictions of the power of environmental toxins to alter human germ plasm and in some cases disrupt human reproductive capacities have come true, and yet the general public seems largely unconcerned, one has to wonder about the extent of mesmerism. In Our Stolen Future: Are We Threatening Our Fertility, Intelligence, and Survival? Theo Colburn, Dianne Dumanoski, and John Peterson Myers document just how chlorine-based synthetic chemicals cause serious reproductive problems in both animals and humans. (42) But the book made much less of a splash than Silent Spring, in part because the public relations efforts of the chemical industry worked to undermine the credibility of the book even before it reached the bookstores. The stakes were even higher for the industry this time around because Colborn and her collaborators focused on the way environmental toxins victimized women and children, both already represented by powerful activist organizations. "No definitive proof!" cried the chemical industry and agribusiness, and that seems to have placated all but the most determined critics in the booming 1990s' economy. (43)

The alternative science, with its view toward maintaining a balanced relationship between humans and their environment that she and a minority of others have advocated, languishes on the fringe of the scientific and cultural discourse. Sandra Harding has argued that a feminist critique of science must have as its agenda the illumination of both science's progressive and regressive tendencies, of science's inherently political nature, of science as a social process. Only after such exposure might it be possible "to use for liberating ends sciences that are apparently so intimately involved in Western, bourgeois, and masculine projects." (44) Rachel Carson would not have assessed Western science in so many words, but her indictments in Silent Spring most certainly served to illuminate these dimensions of science. Without discarding science's benefits to humanity Carson shook her finger at the careless, regressive path science had taken with regard to pesticides. With its call to action Silent Spring was a political statement and its very publication expressed the sentiment that science is a social process.

As the creative director of Vogue magazine, my guest Grace Coddington is one of the most influential editors in the fashion world. Many people outside of the fashion industry know her from the 2009 documentary, "The September Issue," a behind-the-scenes look at publishing the largest, most influential Vogue edition of the year.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-19Although Coddington says she didn't even want to be in the film, she emerged as its star. Now she has a new memoir called "Grace." Coddington is Welsh and began her career in fashion as a model. In the early '60s, when London was becoming the center of the emerging youth fashion world, Coddington was a house model for hair stylist Vidal Sassoon and modeled clothes designed by trendsetter Mary Quant.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-19In 1961, a car accident smashed Coddington's face, interrupting her career for two years. She returned to modeling after several reconstructive surgeries. In 1968, she moved to British Vogue as a junior fashion editor. In 1988, when Anna Wintour became editor-in-chief of American Vogue, Coddington became her fashion editor. They've worked together at Vogue ever since.

I want to start by talking about your earlier life, and then we'll get up to Vogue magazine. Your family ran a hotel, and that's where you grew up. You describe it as a 42-room getaway spot of quiet charm for holiday makers who like to sail, go fishing or take long, bracing cliff-top walks rather than roast themselves on a sunny beach. I have to say that hotel doesn't sound like fashion central.

I don't know how I would have fared if I'd grown up in a big city, but, you know, up until the time of - when I was, I think, 18, I never - I barely saw anyone except in the summer. It was very deserted for the rest of the year, and I loved it that way.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-19I really, I mean I liked - I didn't mind being alone at all.

American Vogue definitely didn't get that far, and even British Vogue barely got that far, and it was always out of date by the time I got it. But it didn't really matter because, you know, not being that fashion conscious at that moment, I guess I didn't notice it was out of date. I just - I just enjoyed, you know, looking at the pictures and dreaming.

It's - you know, the pictures that were really grabbing me in those days were the ones shot on location because they kind of made you dream a lot.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-19And there was a photographer that I guess his work really grabbed me, and that was Norman Parkinson, who much later on I got to meet and work with, both as a model and as an editor.

I mean, I did - I learned how to do my makeup, and I learned how to do my own hair, because in those days, in - models had to know how to do everything themselves. You know, there wasn't - there weren't these huge teams of people that look after one - or look after a model these days and basically do it for her. So you had to be prepared.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-19And I also learned how to walk the runway, but it was in that very old-fashioned, stylized way where you walk up and down, and you kind of slope backwards, slink along the runway, and you carefully take your coat off while you're doing a twirl, and you kind of smile at everybody in the audience. I mean, it's a very formal way of modeling runway that doesn't exist anymore now.

I don't know if she invented it, but somehow she did these clothes that were very, very short, and they were very simple and comfortable to wear, which clothes of the '50s had not been. You know, up until that time, everything was kind of with a very cinched-in waist, probably a big, huge kind of ballerina-length skirt or very, very slim skirt that you could barely walk in.

I mean, I - we don't work with very young girls at Vogue. We just don't. We don't encourage girls of 14, 13, 14, whatever, to get into the whole modeling field at such an early age because, you know, it can mess with your mind, it really can.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-19And also it takes time for your character to develop. So it's unlikely - I mean, there's a few exceptions, you know, people like Twiggy and those - they started modeling very, very young, but they were exceptions. So generally, people's characters don't start forming until they're 18, 19, 20 or even later.

I mean, actually we've been going back and using, over and over again, the same girls that we've been working with for 10, 12 or more years. I worked with a beautiful girl the other day, Carolyn Murphy, and I know she just had her 40th birthday. So - she's never looked better. She's never looked better.

You know, they certainly sell more magazines than models, sadly. I'm very sad about it. I wish it could go back to models, but I don't think it will, just because that's what the people demand. And the general public find that more interesting than a model. And also, there are not so many very strong models that could hold a cover right now - again, I say sadly, but there just aren't.

As the creative director of Vogue magazine, my guest Grace Coddington is one of the most influential editors in the fashion world. Many people outside of the fashion industry know her from the 2009 documentary, "The September Issue," a behind-the-scenes look at publishing the largest, most influential Vogue edition of the year.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-19Although Coddington says she didn't even want to be in the film, she emerged as its star. Now she has a new memoir called "Grace." Coddington is Welsh and began her career in fashion as a model. In the early '60s, when London was becoming the center of the emerging youth fashion world, Coddington was a house model for hair stylist Vidal Sassoon and modeled clothes designed by trendsetter Mary Quant.

She returned to modeling after several reconstructive surgeries. In 1968, she moved to British Vogue as a junior fashion editor. In 1988, when Anna Wintour became editor-in-chief of American Vogue, Coddington became her fashion editor. They've worked together at Vogue ever since.

I want to start by talking about your earlier life, and then we'll get up to Vogue magazine. Your family ran a hotel, and that's where you grew up. You describe it as a 42-room getaway spot of quiet charm for holiday makers who like to sail, go fishing or take long, bracing cliff-top walks rather than roast themselves on a sunny beach. I have to say that hotel doesn't sound like fashion central.

I don't know how I would have fared if I'd grown up in a big city, but, you know, up until the time of - when I was, I think, 18, I never - I barely saw anyone except in the summer. It was very deserted for the rest of the year, and I loved it that way.

I don't know if she invented it, but somehow she did these clothes that were very, very short, and they were very simple and comfortable to wear, which clothes of the '50s had not been. You know, up until that time, everything was kind of with a very cinched-in waist, probably a big, huge kind of ballerina-length skirt or very, very slim skirt that you could barely walk in.

And also, the look was just young. It was really young, and no one up until that point had designed clothes for younger women, you know, girls.

I mean, I - we don't work with very young girls at Vogue. We just don't. We don't encourage girls of 14, 13, 14, whatever, to get into the whole modeling field at such an early age because, you know, it can mess with your mind, it really can.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-19And also it takes time for your character to develop. So it's unlikely - I mean, there's a few exceptions, you know, people like Twiggy and those - they started modeling very, very young, but they were exceptions. So generally, people's characters don't start forming until they're 18, 19, 20 or even later.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-19And I think, you know, they are just much more interesting when they're older. I mean, actually we've been going back and using, over and over again, the same girls that we've been working with for 10, 12 or more years. I worked with a beautiful girl the other day, Carolyn Murphy, and I know she just had her 40th birthday. So - she's never looked better. She's never looked better.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-19And I was really happy to work with her, and she's just started working fulltime again. I think she had a little downtime in between, but she's back living in New York, and she's looking totally gorgeous, and her mind is in a very good place, and she's very calm, and she's a great model.

So how - what's the process of, not only of deciding, but what's the process that the designers use to try to convince you that their line or that, you know, this dress really belongs in Vogue?

I mean, you know, twice a year, there are big - there's the collections, and there's many small collections in between. But twice a year, there are the very big collections that decide the mood of the season. And you go through all the shows and sit for hours watching all the shows and having discussions afterwards with, in my case, Anna and the other editors, and you decide, you know, what direction you're going to take this season.

But it always seems like, at those fashion shows, the clothing that's being showed is clothing that normal, you know, like, ordinary people would absolutely never wear, because the clothes are just so, like, artistically outlandish. Do you know what I mean? Like you wouldn't - like I can't - I can't imagine people actually wearing that, except on the runway.

But, you know, you have to have a bit of fun in life, and that's why they do it, and they do it, you know, to get your attention. They do the extreme ones. You always, you know, when you go back to their showrooms, you'll find the more commercial versions of that, but it's to get across a point.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-19I mean, you have to say it in a strong way to get across a point. So if you want to go short, they go very, very, very short on the runway. And - but you'll find in the showroom, it'll be a reasonable short, you know, that you can wear. So there's always the commercial version.

In order to make the point, you have to say it strongly, so people can see the difference between this season and the last season, and, you know, you have to feed them the information. If you're too subtle about it, you're not going to get it, you know.

And I think this is particularly true of some of the shoots that you do that are kind of like fantasy scenes. I mean, it might be like scenes inspired by "Alice in Wonderland," or scenes inspired by Edith Wharton's fiction or scenes of, like, women in diaphanous silk gowns in a beautiful garden holding hands and circling a tree. I mean, just - they're like fantasy scenes. So when you are asking a designer to do something that's just for a scene in Vogue, what's that process like? Who - how do you approach them...

You can forget about being commercial. You can use all your creative juices, you know. And it's like - yes, it is like making a movie or a little play. And it also - it connects you with each designer, because when I do that, I call them up and have these long chats about what I'm trying to do, like "Alice in Wonderland," which is one of my favorite things - shoots. And I just decided that they could do whatever they wanted, but the dress had to be blue so that there was a connection, and you always knew that the girl was Alice.

They send me drawings. They send me swatches of fabric, and I say that's lovely, but make it shorter or longer or bigger or smaller, or maybe more ruffles or not or what, you know. And it's a sort of work-in-progress, and it goes on right until the minute I'm going to photograph it.

And they both complained that so many of the covers of magazines now are celebrities instead of models. And what they thought was that, you know, actors - celebrity actors are great at acting, but they don't really know how to model. They don't really know what to do in a still photograph, and that models are really best that that. And I'd loved to hear your take on that.

But, I mean, referring to covers, you don't really have to model, I don't think. You just have to be some - have a strong personality that really comes through and basically says buy me. And you have to have a - you have to be interesting to such a wide variety of people. And I guess right now, actresses just do it better. You know, they certainly sell more magazines than models, sadly. I'm very sad about it. I wish it could go back to models, but I don't think it will, just because that's what the people demand. And the general public find that more interesting than a model. And also, there are not so many very strong models that could hold a cover right now - again, I say sadly, but there just aren't.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-20On a sunny summer day, you might be inclined to fire up the barbeque instead of heating up the kitchen to cook a meal. But there's an alternative that doesn't create smoke and utilizes a natural, free energy source: the sun. All you need is a solar cooker, an inexpensive device that harnesses the thermal energy in the sun's rays to achieve temperatures so hot you can cook virtually anything you'd be able to prepare using your regular barbeque, oven, or stove.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-20Solar cooking is becoming more popular as the cost of energy and the interest in self-reliance and green living rise. But it's also a way to provide inexpensive, clean energy in developing countries for cooking and boiling water. It has been estimated that using a solar cooker for a single year can eliminate the need for one ton of firewood.

But there's an alternative that doesn't create smoke and utilizes a natural, free energy source: the sun. All you need is a solar cooker, an inexpensive device that harnesses the thermal energy in the sun's rays to achieve temperatures so hot you can cook virtually anything you'd be able to prepare using your regular barbeque, oven, or stove.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/109/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-20Solar cooking is becoming more popular as the cost of energy and the interest in self-reliance and green living rise. But it's also a way to provide inexpensive, clean energy in developing countries for cooking and boiling water. It has been estimated that using a solar cooker for a single year can eliminate the need for one ton of firewood. And a solar cooker eliminates the need for an open flame, meaning cleaner air for some of the world's poorest and most vulnerable people.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/111/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-20There are many challenges to studying the biology of dinosaurs. T heir skeletons are extremely fragile and, most often, incomplete. Because the bones are fossils, they may be distorted and usually composed ot materials that were very different from what they were made of when living. And, dinosaurs are mainly quire large and physically difficult to study.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/111/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-20Yet, so many ofthe questions researchers need an.swers to are tied up in the bones and how they lit together to make skeletons. They include relatively simple matters, such as how much dinosaurs weighed, what they looked like fleshed our. how they moved, and even what their basic posture was. These questions musi be answered before paleontologists cm progress to addressing more complex problems. So, how do you minimize or circumvent the challenges and start answering these basic questions? Technology holds many of the answers.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/111/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-20These were problems facing Peter Makovicky, dinosaur curator and chair of the Department of Geology ar the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago. He wanted to start detailed biological studies of Sue, the Tymnnosaurus rex, as part of the museum's celebration of the 10lh anniversary of Sue's unveiling. Makovicky turned to us - Ralph Chapman and Linda Deck (Deck & Chapman LLC and New Mexico Virtualization ot Dis Alamos, New Mexico) and Art Andersen (Virtud Surfaces of Mt. Prospect, Illinois)· - because we created the first real digital dinosaur during the 1990s based on the Smithsonian Institution's Triceratops skeleton (see "No Bones About It," February 2001).

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/111/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-20Sue presented all the classic challenges associated with dinosaur skeletons, magnified by the fact that the skeleton is huge even for a large meat-eating dinosaur. Ihe original bones are incorporated inro the mounted skeleton - in the main exhibir hall ofthe Field Museum - and cannot be removed easily for further work. On the plus side, the skeleton is unusually complete, and relatively few of those bones are not original. This was rhe situation we encountered upon entering the project; our task was to address all these conditions and generate a highly-detailed, complete skeleton of the T. rex.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/111/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-20Learning from the Past

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/111/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-20Luckily, we had encountered this situation before and knew how to approach the work, accomplish the task, and keep Sue safe and continuously on display; visitors to the Field Museum would be disappointed if she was unavailable for viewing during their trip. We learned many lessons from virtualizing the Smithsonian's Triceratops and used the solutions we came up with for that project - and, in some instances, improvements on them - to facilitate Sue's entry into the virtual world. I he project was done in three phases.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/111/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-20The first phase was to capture the whole skeleton in 3D at a relatively low resolution. We did this because the configuration ofthe mount of Sue was an awesome accomplishment by the Field Museum staff, which evaluated the bones and determined how they should go together in order to put the skeleton in a reasonable posture. Accomplishing this ilist as well virtually is still far off in the future because it is a very labor-intensive and hands-on process. So the skeleton as mounted represented a great resource that we wanted to use. We decided WC must capture the whole thing - 1 1 feet tall and more than 40 feet long.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/111/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-20To do this, we enlisted the Chicago Police Department (CPD), which had recently purchased a large-format Leica area laser scanner. I hey will be using the device for crime and accident investigations to reconstruct scenes in 3D. Andersen contacted Herb Keeler, rhe person in charge of the police scanning, and asked if they would be interested in working on Chicago's own T. rex. The department decided that scanning the mount would be a good training exercise and that it could generate great publicity tor the CPD.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/111/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-20List fall, the CPD arrived at the Field Museum with the scanner, accessory items, and yellow crime-scene tape. The museum provided several large monitors so the public and press could view the data acquisition as it happened. Museum staff, the police representatives, and the three of us walked around and answered questions raised by that day's visitors, and the atmosphere was festive. A total of seven scans were made, covering more rhan 90 percent of the mount, which allowed us to construct a full virtual copy of it. This model already is being used by researchers to study the animal.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/111/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-20The next phase was far more complex and required quite a bit of time. We needed to make much higher resolution 3D virtual models of the individual bones. How we did this depended on the bone, especially its size and shape. Because we could not work with the original bones, as they were mounted and on display, we used a research-grade cast of each bone. These are the basic objects used by paleontologists to study dinosaurs and are incredibly accurate - taken directly from a highquality mold of the original bone - and easier to study dian the originals because they are much lighter and less fragile.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/111/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-20Most of these cast bones were CT-scanned; Makovicky arranged to have this done at the Loyola Medical Center in Maywood, Illinois, at die outpatient facility. It is not used on the weekends, and the staff donated their time and facilities for this project. The majority of Sue's bones are vertebrae and chevrons, small V-shaped bones under the tail. These bones, along with some ribs and the bones of the arms, hands, legs, and feet, were scanned at the Loyola facility to provide high-resolution data. It is important to note that, most often, multiple bones were scanned simulraneously to cut down on the needed CT time.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/111/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-20Not all die bone casts would fit into the Loyola medical CT scanner. The skull, hip bones, femur, and several ribs and vertebrae were CT-scanned at Fond Motor Company's Non- Destructive Engineering Site located in Livonia, Michigan. Martin Jones, who heads up the large CT scanning facility there, used die one-meter-diameter platform to scan most of these large casts. Some of the hip bones were even too large for this CT scanner, and we contracted with a local company - CubicVision of Deerfield, Illinois - to digitize these using a white-light scanner.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/111/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-20This variety of scannets and providers generated the data that we used to create individual models for all the real bones found as part of Sue's skeleton. What about the few missing bones? For them, we used an approach we developed for the Smithsonian's Triceratops project. If the missing bone is from one side of the animal' - what scientists call part of its bilateral symmetry - then we used the bone from the side it was present, mirror-imaged it, and created it for the needed side. In other cases, die missing bones mostly reflect small size differences (as with some vertebrae in the spine), and for these we could simply scale the bone we didn't have from one that we did have.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/111/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-20The third and final phase of the project, at least for us, is to match the higher-resolution individual cast scans with their position in the lower-resolution, full-skeleton scan made in the first phase. Working with the paleontologists at die Field Museum, we will place each individual bone sain in the exact position of its counterpart, producing a very high resolution, complete animal. This will take time, but will provide tremendous raw material lot addressing questions about the biology of the animal. Now an accurate scientific study of how the dinosaur walked, ran, sat down - any question on any form of movement - can be modeled with the virtual mount. This can lead to high-quality animations of Sue moving.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/111/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-20As a bonus, this project also provides the potential for die museum to use the virtual models for Sue products, which can help generate much- needed funds; the options for marketing, exhibit products, and educational outreach are huge. The interest of Makovicky in answering research questions on the biology of this dinosaur not only should lead to answering those questions - along with more general answers for tyrannosaurs, meat-eating dinosaurs, and dinosaurs in general - but should also provide ways to enhance the marketing, funding, and éducation missions of die owners of Sue, the Field Museum of Natural History.

A Christian Holocaust also occurred; a Roman Catholic Holocaust. Peoples from all over Europe were affected by Adolf Hitler's and Heinrich Himmler's genocide, but the Polish people were affected most of all. The invasion of unsuspecting Poland on September 1, 1939 signaled the beginning of a war that engulfed the entire world.

Local government officials, professors, teachers, priests, other clergy and anyone else who opposed Hitler were arrested by the Gestapo, the German secret police, and jailed. There they were questioned, tortured and starved, then sent to concentration camps like Auschwitz in Poland, Mathausen-Gusen in Austria and Buchenwald, Sachsenhausen and Dachau in Germany.

The most accurate numbers show that 2,719 clergy were imprisoned--1,780 Polish clergymen, 99 Czech clergymen, 411 German and Austrian clergy and the remainder taken from the other nations overrun by the Nazi Third Reich. By liberation day, April 29, 1945, 1,011 had perished.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-20Dachau was not designated as an extermination camp, such as Auschwitz, but was classified as a work camp for "rehabilitable criminals." Death came more slowly and by other means than gas. It came through illness, starvation, torture and exhaustion. A blow to the chest of an emaciated man was enough to kill him, or send him to the hospital, where he would more than likely die. So it was that between December 8 and 14, 1940, that most clergy arrived by trains in sealed cattle cars. Many arrived in poor health.

A priest, particularly a Polish priest, was considered the second lowest form of life, higher only than the Jew. Entrance to Dachau, even to these veterans, was humiliation. Once the guards discovered that priests were on a transport, the priests were singled out for "special greetings" by blows and kicks and clubs. All priestly attire, rosaries, breviaries and crucifixes were taken from them. They were ordered to shower, shaved of their head and facial hair, issued a prison uniform, tattooed, then photographed. (Many times a photograph could not be taken for days until the signs of blows to their faces had begun to fade.) Then, after suffering more humiliations and beatings, they were assigned to a block, or barracks for quarantine purposes to see if any were ill. This could last anywhere from one week to several weeks, depending upon the conditions in the camp. They were assigned to a block based upon their country of origin. Block 26 of Dachau was the German and Austrian priests' block; the Polish, Czech and those clergy from other countries were assigned to Blocks 28 and 30. There would eventually come the assignment to a work commando, a squad assigned to work at a certain place doing a particular job. A priest, a man of God, was now forced to wear the prison uniform of a criminal and designated as a political prisoner of the Reich.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-20The snow commando, comprised mostly of Polish priests, was the second most feared work detail only after the rock quarry detail. Every flake of snow had to be cleared from the camp.

They were given no shovel to assist them; forced to use whatever was at their disposal; hands, a piece of cardboard or wood, even a tabletop was once used to shovel the snow, then empty it into carts. Priests were hitched to these carts like horses, then forced to pull the cart to the nearby Wurm River or just outside the camp, where the carts were emptied and the whole process began again. They were beaten and forced to work the entire time to the point of exhaustion.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-20Dachau concentration camp was unique in that it had something that no other concentration camp had--a garden--not just any garden, but a large area of land devoted to the growing of medicinal herbs, vegetables and fruits, flowers and even a grove of apple trees. It was the priests who cleared the hard, rocky soil, dug the furrows, planted the seeds, weeded and eventually harvested the proceeds. Tools were few and far between, so most of the work was done by hand. 1942 was probably the worst of the camps existence. It was during this time that Dachau's commandant's office was particularly hard on the priest. They were beaten, punished, taunted and forced to work as they had never, nor would ever be during the camp's history.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-20A chapel, only the second in any concentration camp, was furnished in Room 1 of Block 26, the German priests block, on January 15, 1941, and remained in use until liberation day, April 29, 1945. The first Mass was offered on January 22, 1941 by camp chaplain, Father Paul Prabutzky. All of the nearly 900 priests then inside Dachau, including the Polish and Czech priests, were permitted to attend Holy Mass. Unconsecrated hosts were smuggled inside Dachau or sent inside parcels that prisoners were permitted to receive on a monthly basis. The Polish and Czech priests and those from other nations were cruelly forbidden to enter the chapel from September 21, 1941 until the end under penalty of death.

This beautiful statue, intricately carved from wood, was smuggled inside Dachau at Easter, 1943, buried inside a cart filled with vegetables. She was immediately placed near the door of the chapel. The German and Austrian priests made certain that fresh flowers were placed before Our Lady every day. Countless priests of all nations crawled with their last ounces of strength or somehow made their way to Block 26 to die at the feet of Our Blessed Mother and the Christ Child. So great was their love for Our Blessed Mother that they uttered their last prayers before her image. The Rosary was said often, not only in the chapel, but also at work in secret, an act that was punishable by death. Not even the forces of evil could take the presence of Our Lady and Our Lord Jesus from this hell on earth.

Once again the Polish priests displayed their great courage and their great devotion, they awakened every morning one hour before roll call to celebrate Holy Mass in their individual rooms in their barracks. The chalice was an ordinary glass and a flat piece of metal was the paten. An aluminum cup served as a ciborium.

On Saturday, March 28, after Block 28 had entered the large communal shower to clean themselves, their clothing was searched. One of the Polish priests, Father Stanislaw Wierbowski, had pasted $729 inside the front cover of his breviary upon his arrest; money that had been given to him by the seminary of Lomza for his safekeeping. Father Wierbowski decided he would carry the money on his person after his breviary was returned to him. The money was found by another prisoner and Father was beaten to death.

Their suffering began on Palm Sunday and continued until Holy Saturday. Punishment drills, consisting of deep knee bends, running and strenuous exercises, were performed from six o'clock in the morning until seven o'clock at night, with only a one-hour rest and lunch period.

Error1 No ip field @ /home/ec2-user/ummdp/logfiles/114/app/2014/elibdmz-elibweb_usage.log.2014-10-20The ill priests were even taken from the hospital, and forced to watch both the young and older priests in their sixties and seventies, all half-starved, perform these drills. Eight priests collapsed and died that week from exhaustion and heart attacks. It is not known how many died later as a result of this punishment. It was one week that those who survived did not, nor would ever, forget.

Himmler had decided that the camp's population had to be decreased. SS Lieutenant Josef Jarolin willingly undertook this evil task.

He methodically composed lists of between 100 and 120 of those whom he considered to be "useless eaters" and those who openly refused to be broken by him. Three hundred and thirty-six Polish priests were murdered.

Autopsies showed that all of the priests were murdered by injections of carbolic acid/benzene (lighter fluid).

Bishop Kozal was born on September 25, 1893. In spite of his position, he shunned all special treatment by his fellow priest-prisoners and was a constant inspiration to them. He entered the prisoners' hospital with an inner ear infection and was killed by an injection of benzene during the night of January 26, 1943.

Human life was obviously considered to be less important than that of an animal.

Some were injected with malaria, others were bitten by mosquitoes infected with the disease. Danger came not only from the disease itself, but from the cures. Some were treated by means of pyridine, others with quinine, and still others were immersed in water heated to 104 degrees for several hours, then were put into bed and covered with blankets in an effort to have the patient kill the organism with his own body heat. Many died from pyridine overdose.

Polish priests exclusively were used for this experiment. Eyewitness testimony from Father Marian Magnuszewski gives an account of an experiment which began on November 11, 1942. A group of 20 priests was selected for experimentation. They were first examined and x-rayed for suitability, then sent to Block 1, Room 3. The group was divided in half. All were injected in the left arm and the right leg with a specially cultivated pus. Group A was treated by means of antibiotics (sulfur drugs), while Group B was treated by allopathic (herbs and vitamins) and amputation.

Incredible agony was followed by death. It was thanks to the efforts of chief nurseman Heinrich Stoehr that a small number did survive.

These courageous men and women of God were imprisoned, tortured and murdered simply because they publicly spoke out against the evil of their times, against a Godless philosophy, a Godless government. They are no different than the present-day martyrs of countries far from the United States.

The largest number of them, 42 to be exact, were imprisoned and died inside Dachau. Let us speak and teach of them, of their patriotism, their love for God, their courage in the face of danger, resignation to the Will of God that, by their lives, and their deaths, they may inspire us and our children.
